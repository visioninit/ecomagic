<h1>About Magic</h1>
<p>Magic is people learning and communicating how humans can further common
 good by practicing valuescience—scientific methods and principles applied
 to questions of value.</p>
<img class=""picframe fright horiz"" src=""/images/porchgroup.jpg""/>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>What We Do</h2>
<p>We work in a radical, integrated,
 scientific way to increase human
 satisfaction and reduce human suffering.
<p>By ""radical"" we mean that we go to
 the roots of dissatisfaction and suffering. We perceive those roots to
 lie in misinformation about value—about what people want,
 how
 to
 get it, and most
 importantly, how
 we can know these things.
<p>We use ""integrated"" to denote two things. First, we mean that we
 aim to simultaneously: cultivate individual health and awareness,
 
 promote social justice, peace, and freedom, and 
 increase and protect wealth, including environmental quality. Second,
 we mean that we work both as a ""think
 tank,"" to generate new ideas and assess the validity of information
 from diverse sources, and as a hands-on organization to demonstrate
 how people can use valuescience to inform more effective action for
 common good. 
<p>By ""scientific"" we mean that we: (1) hold ideas
 open to question; (2) observe self and surroundings carefully; (3) search
 for pattern
 on
 which to base accurate prediction; (4) experiment to test ideas; and (4)
 apply lessons learned by others practicing science.
<p>We research, teach, counsel, consult, lecture, publish, and 
conduct demonstration projects. Central among Magic's programs is a 
 
residential service-learning community where participants are joined 
in learning to apply valuescience to discern and further common interests of
 
humankind.</p>
<p><a href=""magic"">Since <em>Magic</em>'s founding</a>, tens of thousands
 of people have benefitted directly, and many more have benefitted indirectly
 from the work done in its name. 
Magicians' achievements in health education, dispute resolution, 
community development, and environmental stewardship have been 
honored with local, national, and international awards and recognition, 
including acceptance for presentation at peer-reviewed scientific conferences
 and publication in top-tier scientific journals. The Magic residential service
 learning community has been featured in the <em>Communities Directory, A Guide
 to Intentional Communities and Cooperative Living</em>, in <em>Communities,
 a Journal of Cooperative Living</em>, in <em>Stanford</em> magazine, and in
 a variety of other print, film, and audio media.</p>
<p>Going forward we're concentrating on 
 explicit communication about how and why to practice valuescience. We're producing
 additional presentation media, developing curricula (especially for residential
 service
 learning),
 and writing
 more for publication. We're
 also growing the Magic
 community of service
 with special
 attention to
 a target
 audience
 of innovators and early
 adopters. And we're improving and adding facilities
 to support more effective and expanded service, and to better ""walk our talk.""</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Why We Do It</h2>
<p>We work for common good because we perceive that essential to our own satisfaction.</p>
<p>We take a valuescience approach because: (1)
 the human condition is increasingly a reflection of action based
 on ideas about
 value; (2) enormous and growing adverse and unanticipated
 consequences of human action evidence widespread and numerous mistaken
 ideas about value, and more importantly, about how we can recognize and enjoy
 value; and
 (3) valuescience
 is the sole demonstrated means for more accurately discerning and more fully
 realizing value, that is, for informing behavior by which we make desired
 outcomes more common and deleterious outcomes less so.</p>
<p>We make communication about valuescience central because:
 (1) though
 everyone practices valuescience to some degree, few of us do so consciously,
 all of us tap only a fraction of its potential, and all suffer as a result
 of relying
 sometimes on
 other
 methods;
 (2) though many
 individuals and organizations
 are
 tiptoeing towards greater utilization of valuescience, few have acknowledged,
 many contest, and many flatly deny necessity for replacing other ways of knowing
 value with it; and (3) we perceive that broad acceptance
 of this
 necessity
 is essential to successful human adaptation.</p>
<p>We research, teach, and conduct hands-on projects
 because we consider both ideas
 and their implementation to be important. We aim to contribute valid theory
 in which to ground effective practice, and effective practice in which to ground
 valid theory. We base Magic in a residential service-learning community so
 that we may better
 ""walk
 our
 talk""
 because we
 hear a ring
 of truth in Thoreau's words, ""What you are speaks so loudly that I
 cannot hear
 a word
 you
 say.""</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Who We Are</h2>
<p>Three fellows, each with a tenure of more than fifteen years, shoulder primary
 responsibility for operating <em>Magic</em>. Several dozen associates and affiliates,
 including about a dozen who live in the Magic residential service learning
 community, play key roles. Operating personnel are overseen by a board of directors
 and draw upon counsel from a board of advisors. Each year hundreds of volunteers,
 donors, clients, and program participants contribute labor, material, money,
 and advocacy to make <em>Magic</em>.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>What You Can Do</h2>
<p>We invite your partnership in valuescience-based philanthropy. You can invest
 in many ways: learn, be a client, 
volunteer, donate, advocate, or simply give us your thoughts about 
what we are and do.<em>Magic</em>.</p>

<h2>Thank you!</h2>
<p>Thank you for your interest in <em>Magic</em>. We're grateful to be sharing
 with you the rewards of practicing valuescience to further common good.</p>

<h2>30 Years of Magic</h2>
<p>People have come to <em>Magic</em> to clear heads of nonsense, and to
 fill hearts with love. Since 1979 We've been evolving to better discern
 and further common interests of humankind.
 </p>
<p>In the realm of idea we began with a mandate to study and teach human
 ecology. From the outset we were attentive to apparent conflicts between
 economic and ecological approaches to value. By the early 1980's we were
 teaching the first course in Ecological Economics to be offered at Stanford
 University. Over the next two decades we've developed the concept of valuescience
 and disseminated it through teaching, publishing, and demonstration projects.</p>
<p>We've shaped an all-volunteer organization and robust community of service.
 At the center of this community are residential service
 learning program participants who shoulder primary responsibility for
 operating Magic for benefit of the general public. Key
 operating personnel, board members, and other supporters include exceptionally
 talented and accomplished individuals with demonstrated commitment
 to furthering
 common
 good. A number have been associated with Magic for a decade or more. </p>
<p>We've generated
 an organizational structure and culture which reflect our mission, relying
 heavily upon gifts of material and labor, making fund-raising incidental
 to our service activities, and providing personnel freedom to learn and
 serve in ways suited to individual circumstance. We've built a modest
 asset base that includes three adjacent Palo Alto residences that Magic's
 service learning community occupies.</p>
<p>From this foundation of ideas, people, and other resources we've 
 created programs to shed light on common human values and how people may
 effectively
 further
 them. With Magic programs we aim to provide opportunities for participants
 to cultivate individual health
 and awareness, promote social justice, peace, and freedom, and increase
 and protect wealth, including environmental quality.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""fleft picframe horiz"" src=""/images/mulch.jpg""/></p>
<p>Since 1979 we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>presented valuescience, an ecological approach to value, to more than 25,000
 people</li>
<li>taught sound health practices including values clarification and life-planning;
 swimming, cycling, and running; and science-based eating to more than 5,000
 people</li>
<li>provided instruction and mentoring to more than 1,000 youths</li>
<li>founded and sustained a valuescience-based residential service learning
 community and an Evergreen Park Neighborhood Association which continue today</li>
<li>participated in creating numerous other cooperative ventures (e.g. food
 buying co-ops, intentional communities, non-profit ventures, neighborhood
 renewal groups, childcare co-ops)</li>
<li>mediated resolution of more than a thousand domestic, commercial, and neighborhood
 disputes, including community conflicts to which thousands of diverse individuals
 were parties</li>
<li>salvaged 40,000 surplus fruit trees and distributed them to 20,000 children
 in the context of an integrated natural and social science curriculum we
 designed</li>
<li>written mathematical models and computer software to simulate the ecological and economic impacts of urban tree management policies</li>
<li>secured adoption of the first pavement shading standard for municipal street
 tree management</li>
<li>organized, trained, and guided more than 4,000 volunteers from more than two dozen Bay Area cities and towns to plant more than 10,000 trees along streets, in parks, on home grounds, and on openspace lands</li>
<li>redesigned and oversaw reconstruction of residential streets to divert tens
 of thousands of short-cutters out of neighborhoods and onto main roads</li>
<li>rewritten and secured passage of sections of the Palo Alto Comprehensive
 Plan calling for safer neighborhood streets and for street tree planting,
 and organized residents to lobby successfully to limit additional building
 and paving in Palo Alto</li>
<li>published research and demonstration project results in state, national,
 and international meetings, in lay and professional journals, and in
 proprietary monographs, many of which have been distributed
 worldwide.
 </li></ul>
<p>On the basis of these achievements we have won national and international
 awards and recognition for assessing ecological impacts of climate change
 (<em>International Oaks</em>), swim instruction (<em>New Zealand
 Triathlete</em>),
 urban forest planning (Journal of Arboriculture), mediation and community
 development (American Society of Landscape
 Architects), habitat restoration (<em>Audubon</em>), transportation planning (Renew
 America), river-floodplain stewardship (<em>BioScience</em>), valuescience
 (Society for Ecological Restoration), and public service (Stanford University).</p>
<p>Although Magicians reflect with satisfaction upon the purposefulness and
 enthusiasm we've brought to our work, and although we are grateful for
 the appreciation others have shown for our accomplishments, we remain cautious
 in assessing our contribution to human well-being. We're aware of many
 instances where people celebrated results obtained over a few years or
 decades, only to later realize that adverse impacts outweighed
 gains.</p>
<p>We're grateful to the many people who've made Magic to date, and we look
 forward to continuing to grow the Magic community of service. If you think
 you may enjoy making Magic, we'll welcome your inquiry.</p>

 research;
 </li>
<li>create media to communicate valuescience to an ""early adopter"" target
 audience and the general public; 
 </li>
<li>enhance the residential service-learning program through which we demonstrate
 valuescience-based living, afford opportunity for immersion learning, and
 provide a cost-effective means to operate Magic and deliver its benefits
 to the
 general public;
 </li>
<li>increase the number of classes, seminars, workshops, public presentations,
 demonstration projects, publications, and consultations to bring valuescience
 to a wider audience; 
 </li>
<li>
 recruit and retain additional exceptionally qualified personnel;
 </li>
<li>
 grow participation and elicit sufficient support from participants to make
 benefits of valuescience available to more people;
 </li>
<li>

10,Why Magic?,magic,"<div class=""main"">
<h1>Why Magic?</h1>
<img class=""fright picframe vert"" src=""/images/david-1.jpg""/>
<p>People tell us, ""I love the name,"" and they tell us, ""That's an awful name."" Some ask, ""What does magic have to do with science?"" or, ""Is it an acronym?""</p>
<p>Like most aspects of <em>Magic</em>, our name has elements of both intention and serendipity.</p>
<p>Back in the summer of 1972 a bunch of us were camping out in life-home was a backpack or a van or a gym lockers. We bounced around among the mountains, the beaches, the social experiments, and the university campuses of Northern California.</p>
<p>Wanting some way to stay in touch - there was no 'net,' and small computers were the size of your refrigerator! - we went to the post office to rent a box. The postmaster informed us, ""Unrelated individuals cannot share a box.""</p>
<p>One of us asked, ""What about organizations?""<br/>
""They're different,"" he acknowledged.<br/>
""OK, then, this'll be the <em>Magic</em> box.""<br/>
""What are you talking about?""<br/>
""We're <em>Magic</em>. It's an organization. We want to rent a box.""<br/>The postmaster lightened up a bit. ""OK, but remember, every piece of mail we deliver there has to have '<em>Magic</em>' on it.""</p>
<p>By 1975, when some of us rented a home together in Palo Alto, and began working as a team to address issues of individual, social, and environmental well-being in an integrated way, we were already known as <em>Magic</em>. With each project and event, the name became better established.</p>
<p>In 1979, we decided to incorporate as a 501(c)(3) public benefit organization.
 Though we considered names like ""Center for Human Ecology,"" <em>Magic</em> seemed
 to capture more of our style and spirit. After all, 'real' magic is about
 using science to surprise and delight, and
 that's what we aim to do.</p>
<h2>What Basis Community?</h2>
<p><em>Magic</em> was a community of friends before it was incorporated as
 a public service organization. Like many who came of age in the 1960's,
 the first <em>Magicians</em> had enjoyed a sweet ride on the post-War economic
 boom and the reforms of the Great Society. Material life seemed steadily
 better. We thought we were able to discern progress towards
 health, wealth, freedom, justice, and peace.</p>
<p>John and Paul sang, ""All you need is love,"" and it sounded good
 to us. We dreamed of leaving behind material excess and cooperating for
 mutual benefit, of working towards our ideals and enjoying each moment,
 rather than grinding away at a job at best tangentially connected to our
 highest aspirations and counting days until retirement.</p>
<p>Our original credo was, ""Science and loving,"" because we considered
 the reintegration of what used to be called natural philosophy (science)
 and moral philosophy (ethics) a necessary step towards our and others'
 living better.</p>
<p>Forming an intentional community was a way to ""walk our talk."" We
 wanted partners in living healthfully, in practicing peaceful conflict
 resolution, and in learning to generate more satisfaction within. Owning
 only one car was easier if six of us lived under the same roof. Seeing
 our own
 foibles was more likely when so much of our ""private"" lives was
 exposed to others who shared our goal of seeing self and world more accurately.
 And together we were able to demonstrate what alone we were only able to
 talk
 about.</p>
<p>Like many who engaged in similar experiments, we fell short of being as
 we imagined. We were comfortable living within our means, so money for
 today was rarely an issue. Still we feared what might occur were we to
 separate. In the sexual realm we experimented, and wound up competing for
 rank in our nominally non-hierarchical group. The women among us, especially,
 wondered about child-bearing and rearing. Barraged with criticism and dire
 warnings from family, friends, and even relative strangers, we looked often
 at the rewards
 being reaped by peers on other paths, and doubted our own choices.</p>
<p>In 1979, we realized that dedication to some purpose beyond satisfaction
 of our own desires to be comfortable and to propagate was essential. We
 decided to become a public benefit corporation which simultaneously addressed
 human potential, peace and justice, and environmental protection, and we
 rooted
 our approach
 to all of these in ecology.</p>
<p>Despite lots of good works and fun living, we experienced steady turnover.
 Hopes for acquiring additional nearby homes, or growing large enough to
 occupy a rural 'sister' site remained unfulfilled. In the 1980's several
 founders and long-term residents left.</p>
<p>Over the past several years we have
 refounded <em>Magic</em> with
 a much stronger emphasis on public service. Many recent and current residents
 have participated in <em>Magic</em> service activities for months or
 years before living here. Now about a dozen adults ranging in age from
 20 to
 60,
 twin
 girls
 born
 in 1999,
 and
 a boy born in 2004 live
 together.</p>
<p>The <em>Magic</em> residential community blends smoothly into a larger
 community of service which includes several dozen affiliates who regularly
 volunteer, or contribute money,
 or participate in <em>Magic's</em> programs,
 and hundreds more who do these things occasionally. A number of these folks,
 including former residents and other close friends, live within a few
 blocks. Gradually we are developing
 a more inclusive and diverse group, capable of demonstrating by our interactions
 with each other and with the world beyond advantages of a valuescience
 approach to living.</p>

11,Beyond Illusion,beyond,"<div class=""main"">
<h1>Valuescience</h1>
<h2>Why We Offer This Course</h2>
<p>Each of us may view her or his life as a response to three basic questions: To what purposes do I live? By what means may I further my purposes? On what bases do I decide these things?</p>
<p>For several thousand years people have engaged in ever more rapid, elaborate, and large-scale action aimed at improving our condition. Despite all of this activity, total human suffering may be greater at this moment than ever before. As Pogo proclaimed, ""We have met the enemy and he is us.""</p>
<p>Are we to suffer steadily more? Or may we improve the quality of our own existence, and that of those around us, while laying a foundation for further gains by those who may follow us?</p>
<p>How completely may we shed our illusions, and bring our aspirations within the bounds of the possible? By cultivating a more accurate understanding of the world and our place in it, and of ourselves, may we learn to see more clearly the purposes to which we live and the actions by which we may further them?</p>
<p>We at <em>Magic</em> perceive the methods and accumulated principles of
 human ecology (which we define as the scientific investigation of the interactions
 among humans, and between humans and the other elements of the environment)
 to be exceptionally powerful tools for learning rules of the game of life,
 and for identifying strategies by which to live well. We view human ecology
 as a core element of valuescience.</p>
<p>We offer this course so that we and others may develop our capacities to generate harmony within, with our fellow humans, and with the rest of nature.</p>
<h2>What We Do in This Course</h2>
<p>In the course we learn the fundamentals of ecoscience. Then we apply them to examine what people commonly think and do, and why. Finally we bring them to bear upon our own lives, and use them to become more as we intend.</p>
<p>We have divided the course contents into ten topics for presentation in this prospectus, and we often offer the course over a ten-week period, meeting from one to five times per week. When we meet more frequently or for longer periods, we address topics more broadly and more deeply. Sometimes we present a ""short course"" in which we compress or omit topics.</p>
<p>We aim to accommodate the interests, aptitudes, and understanding of participants. In the objectives and outline included later in this prospectus we have listed questions indicative of approaches we have found fruitful in the past.</p>
<p>Our methods include reading, writing, and discussion, as well as observing ourselves, others, and the natural and artificial elements of our environment. We place special emphasis upon practicing what we learn to alter patterns of our everyday lives.</p>
<p>We build the course upon a five-step sequence, often repeated:</p>
<ol>
<li>become more aware of how we are being and what we are doing;</li>
<li>imagine alternatives;</li>
<li>critically evaluate consequences of our current ways and of other possibilities before us;</li>
<li>choose what we prefer;</li>
<li>cultivate the being we intend. Near the outset, participants may respond in writing to questions formulated to elicit some of the basic ideas from which each of us generates a self and a way of living. With this writing we establish benchmarks against which to measure change.</li>
</ol>
<p>Next, we gain familiarity with a modern scientific world-view, and with its roots. We delve into the possible purposes for which living organisms created science, and we consider its evolution, and its import in human affairs during the past two centuries. We review the central precepts of contemporary science, and outline the fundamentals of ecoscience, with particular attention to how completely this discipline is integrated with other natural sciences.</p>
<p>Then we address culture. First we examine the evolution of culture in animals, including our own species. Next we reconsider ideas about wealth, viewing them as elements of culture, as evidence of adaptive strategies, and as reflections of values and understanding of their proponents. Finally, we illuminate various common ""-isms"" and ideologies with an eye to reconciling apparent incongruities between economic and ecological paradigms.</p>
<p>In the latter portion of the course, we evaluate the human condition and our prospects. Exploring a range of future visions ranging from sanguine to apocalyptic, we analyze possible connections among paths we choose personally, and aspirations we hold for ourselves, for others, and for the larger environment. Surveying diverse techniques by which people have intentionally changed thinking, feeling, and other behaviors, we reassess our own repertoires for self-realization, and experiment with different ways of becoming.</p>
<p>We end with a search for common values and means for effectively furthering them. Throughout the course we become better acquainted with each other, and better able both to continue independently and to support others in the sequence of learning and personal change which we practice together here.</p>

12,Creating Loving Community,community,"<div class=""main"">
<h1>Creating Loving Community</h1>
<img class=""fright picframe horiz"" src=""/images/family.jpg""/>
<p>Many of us feel a yearning for social relationships deeper, more permanent, more meaningful than those characteristic of our era. We long for a sense of common interest, mutual understanding, and trust which we vaguely associate with people and places past.</p>
<p>Since its inception in 1972, <em>Magic</em> has
 been a context for exploring the kinds of community which are possible
 in the
 modern world.
 We have sponsored experiments in communalism, cooperative householding,
 neighborhood association, consumer cooperative, barter economy, worker
 self-management, and public service enterprise.</p>
<p>Out of these experiences we have generated an approach to community which is centered upon shared values. We offer <em>Creating Loving Community</em> workshops for people who want to develop an ethos of mutual interest in the places where they live, work, and play.</p>
<p>Workshops range in emphasis to accommodate participants' objectives. Some are more focused upon couples and intimates. Others are designed to provide guidance for people who contemplate sharing a household or joining with others in a co-housing venture. Still others are for people who want to create more effective workplace teams.</p>
<p>Workshops may be conducted at <em>Magic</em>, at client-selected sites, or in other settings. They may entail repeated meetings, or a single session of a few hours to several days.</p>
<p>Whatever their particular theme, activities, or format, <em>Creating Loving Community</em> workshops are founded in the idea that loving, in the sense of assiduously seeking to identify and further common good, is key to living well. Through the workshop activities, participants are given opportunity and tools to assess what they offer and ask of others, and to learn how to alter behavior to sustain the kinds of community to which they aspire.</p>
<p>We offer <em>Creating Loving Community</em> because we have enjoyed so many of the benefits of stronger community in our own lives. We perceive that by learning to more often make common cause, humans can both survive and thrive.<br/></p>

<h1>Planning for Living</h1>
<img class=""fright picframe vert"" src=""/images/jeff-1.jpg""/>
<p><strong>Can you name anyone who feels that the days are a perfect length? </strong>Almost all of carry a sense that life is too short. To do so is to guarantee that we will be dissatisfied.</p>
<p>An alternative is to discover our purposes and the limits within which we may act to further them, and then to cultivate our ability to feel content with what we are able to do and be.</p>
<p>Though this may sound straightforward, few of us actually do it. Typically, we found our lives on ideas about purpose and path which we adopted as children, largely as a result of circumstance. We march through our days like little robots on all-too-predictable paths from cradle to grave.</p>
<p>To shed the mistakes we inherited by accident of birth and upbringing,
 we will necessarily question much that we take for granted. Yet the very
 sense of hurry and pressure that characterizes our dissatisfaction is all-too-frequently
 an impediment to our reflecting very deeply on anything.</p>
<p>By regular planning, recording, and reviewing, we can break this cycle. We can become more conscious of our everyday choices and their consequences. We can even increase the likelihood that we will bring intention and action into consonance, and thus transcend some of the cognitive dissonance so widespread in our era.</p>
<p>In <em>Planning for Living</em>, we ask what we may conclude about purposes
 of life from evidence of billions of years of biological evolution,
 including several hundred thousand years of human culture. We also outline
 some boundary conditions on our lives which are determined by natural law.
 Then do we proceed to plan how we shall live, and to learn ways of replacing
 old, unwanted habits with new choices.</p>
<p>We at <em>Magic</em> teach life planning because we employ it with satisfaction.
 Since 1974 key <em>Magic</em> personnel have been evolving effective methods
 for identifying and realizing both individual and common aspirations.
 Techniques we offer in <em>Planning for Living</em> are a sampling
 of our practices. We've developed these by drawing from traditions and
 approaches ranging from Buddhist meditation to Frederick
 Winslow Taylor's time and motion studies.
 We intend them as stimulus for you to exercise your imagination
 in synthesizing your own unique strategy for this critical aspect of living.</p>

14,Yoga and Friends,yoga,"<div class=""main"">
<h1>Yoga and Friends</h1>
<img class=""picframe fright vert"" src=""/images/lauren-1.jpg""/>
<p>In <em>Yoga and Friends</em> we combine one to two hours of hatha yoga
 instruction and practice with a sociable vegetarian potluck supper. Through
 this program <em>Magic</em> provides
 a disciplined - yet relaxed and informal - context for individuals to refine
 hatha yoga skills, and to build community with others by sharing in the
 preparation and enjoyment of an evening meal.</p>
<p>Hatha yoga asanas (postures) have been developed over many centuries.
 Millions of people, including athletes, physicians, and psychologists,
 have experienced or observed that hatha yoga practitioners preserve and
 enhance suppleness, strength, balance, relaxation, concentration, calm,
 and general well-being.</p>
<p>Participants in <em>Yoga and Friends</em> range from teenagers to seniors,
 from novices to those who have practiced regularly for years. We are united
 in viewing hatha yoga as a path to greater personal awareness, rather than
 merely a set of postures or movements to be mastered in perfect form.</p>
<p>We train together in large part so that we may assist each other in
 remembering our overarching purpose: to become more loving. For us,
 concentration, awareness, flexibility, and calm developed through hatha
 yoga are steps towards greater peace within, with others, and with
 nature. When weather permits, class is held in Peers Park in Palo Alto.
 At other times, we meet indoors at nearby facilities.</p>
<p>Enrollment in each ten-session series is limited to sixteen. Series commence
 near the beginning of calendar quarters. Instruction most quarters begins
 between 5 and 6 on a weekday evening which we vary from quarter
 to quarter. Classes are lead by Magic associates who've qualified as yoga
 instructors or who have sustained and evidenced
 ability to guide others in developing committed yoga practices.</p>
<p>Like many <em>Magic</em> activities, <em>Yoga and Friends</em> is sustained
 by voluntary gift. Some choose to give by assisting in preparing the practice
 space prior to each session. Others make money contributions. Each series
 is partially funded by those who have completed previous series. After
 the
 tenth and
 final
 session,
 participants
 are invited
 to
 contribute so that <em>Magic</em> may continue the program, and others
 may benefit as they have.</p>

16,For Common Good,mediation,"<div class=""main"">
<h1>For Common Good</h1>
<p>Few experiences are so satisfying or so profitable as settling differences
 quickly, inexpensively, and to mutual benefit. Magic offers reconciliation
 and mediation services based upon decades of experience assisting thousands
 of people to resolve conflict for mutual benefit.</p>
<h2>What Are My Alternatives?</h2>
<p>People respond to conflict in many ways. Some try to ignore it. Others negotiate, with or without outside assistance. Some wage psychological battles, or resort to harassment or physical violence. Others submit to non-binding or binding arbitration, or file civil or criminal complaints.</p>
<h2>What Is Mediation?</h2>
<p>Mediation is a voluntary process in which a neutral person—the mediator—assists
 people in resolving conflict.</p>
<p>A skilled mediator enables disputants to see their own and each other's
 interests more clearly, and to discover solutions which are advantageous
 to all. Unlike arbitrators or judges—both of whom decide outcomes—a mediator
 assists parties in settling matters themselves.</p>
<h2>Why Choose Mediation?</h2>
<p>Mediation has advantages over other approaches. More than 80% of mediated
 disputes end in agreement. Terms of these agreements are more often
 fulfilled than are those of settlements imposed by a court. Mediation is
 faster and less expensive than litigation, and it is confidential, so your
 dispute stays out of court records.</p>
<p>You retain flexibility to create solutions that suit your circumstances. You also have opportunity to establish or repair relationships with other parties.</p>
<p>You gain skill and confidence in resolving disputes. You lessen the stress which comes with being in conflict or having someone else imposing a judgment on you. Finally, you preserve your options to arbitrate or to sue if you reach an impasse.</p>
<h2>Preparation</h2>
<p>Please come prepared to present your views. Bring any supporting documents
 or other material which may be useful in clarifying the situation. In cases
 where stakes are high or issues are complex, <em>Magic</em> may
 require clients to retain legal, tax, or other expert counsel.</p>
<h2>Fees</h2>
<p>Fees are paid in advance for an eight-hour day. Any amount unused, less our four-hour minimum, is refunded. The majority of mediations are concluded within a single day. <em>Magic</em> is
 a public benefit corporation which waives or adjusts its fees as public
 interest warrants.</p>
<h2>Personnel</h2>
<p>David Schrom is <em>Magic's</em> principal mediator. He graduated from Yale Law School in 1971. Since founding <em>Magic</em> in 1979 he has facilitated resolution of hundreds of family, neighborhood, and commercial disputes, including complex and bitter multi-party conflicts among people of diverse cultural and socio-economic backgrounds.</p>
<p>David has taught about genetic and cultural bases for aggression and altruism,
 and about cooperative conflict resolution at Stanford University, at Bay
 Area schools, and in business and community settings.</p>

17,Light on Water,water,"<div class=""main"">
<h1>Light on Water</h1>
<p>One warm spring day in 1990, a Stanford University civil engineering professor lectured about impending water shortages and about how pumping water is the single largest use of electricity in California. Robin Bayer, then a Stanford undergraduate and now <em>Magic's</em> president, glanced out the classroom window and saw sprinklers throwing their streams through fifty feet of hot, dry air. At that moment she resolved to bring the lessons of her classroom to the operations of the university, and Light on Water was born.</p>
<p>Since that time, we've expanded the purposes of Light on Water. Our aims now are to:</p>
<ol>
<li>illuminate the importance of water to human life and the ecological constraints upon human use of water, and</li>
<li>provide research, consulting, and advocacy to promote ecologically sound water resource stewardship.</li>
</ol>
<h2><em>Magic's</em> accomplishments to date include:</h2>
<ul>
<li>1990-present: draw plans for, install, and maintain native trees and understory species around natural and artificial surface water features including several ""vernal pools"" created to accept storm water run-off and obviate expensive increases to Stanford University storm drain capacity, and others created to provide habitat for a locally rare tiger salamander (Ambystoma californiense)</li>
<li>1992-94: prepare an ecologically-based water management plan for Stanford University</li>
<li>1993-96: lead successful opposition to a City of Palo Alto proposal to build a multi-million dollar pumping facility and pipeline for distributing wastewater contaminated with salt and heavy metals to Palo Alto and Stanford University for irrigation</li>
<li>1996-99: conduct a study of riparian forest regeneration for the United States Environmental Protection Agency, and publish our results as ""Floodplain Formation and Cottonwood Colonization Patterns on the Willamette River, Oregon, USA"" (Environmental Management, Vol. 25, No. 1, pp. 87-104).</li>
<li>1998: research river-floodplain system response to climate change and publish ""How the 100-year Flood Became an Annual Event,""
(Palo Alto Weekly, April 8, 1998) to alert Palo Altans that proposed flood control measures were insufficient to prevent recurrent substantial losses similar to those of 1998</li>
<li>2000-present: (in partnership with Ecohydrology West of Santa Cruz, CA) conduct a campaign to improve river-floodplain stewardship throughout the U.S. To date we have:
 <ul>
<li>assembled the first state-by-state description of statutes and common law pertaining to public ownership of streambeds and floodplain in each of the fifty states,</li>
<li>performed the first quantitative assessment of rates of island-derived floodplain formation on public streambeds,</li>
<li>shown how public ownership affords a grossly under-exploited opportunity for ecologically sound stewardship of hundreds of thousands of kilometers of streambeds and hundreds of thousands of hectares of floodplain, and</li>
<li>published <em>Public Ownership of US Streambeds and Floodplains: A Basis for Ecological Stewardship</em> escribing our findings and analyzing them in <em>BioScience</em>, a peer-reviewed scientific journal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ongoing Projects</h2>
<p>We are currently:</p>
<ul>
<li>working in partnership with Ecohydrology West and with individuals in state agencies and environmental advocacy groups around the nation to inventory publicly-owned streambeds and floodplain, and assert public ownership prerogatives to protect and enhance ecological integrity and its myriad benefits;</li>
<li>collaborating with personnel from the Stanford University Planning Office
 and from Stanford University Facilities Operations to extend and maintain
 native
 species habitat and populations around existing
 and new surface water features
 so that stormwater resources are more effectively stewarded;</li>
<li>developing strategies for Palo Alto storm water management that will reduce costs of proposed storm drain repair and modification, increase utilization of storm water resource, and improve public safety.</li>
</ul>

 expectations for positive change, and showing how the subject matter and
 skills in each lesson may be applied to improve the quality of the
 student's life, and to contribute to the well-being of others.</p>
<p>A large fraction of our mentoring relationships persist for several
 years. As mentor and student collaborate successfully, they gain the
 confidence and trust in each other requisite to becoming a more
 effective team. We also respond to requests for short-term assistance,
 as for example, when a student requests temporary support in
 re-establishing a pattern of satisfactory scholastic achievement which
 was interrupted with change in schools, teachers, subjects, or family
 circumstances.</p>
<p>We teach a broad range of traditional academic subjects at levels
 from junior high school through college to people of all ages. We also
 teach English as a foreign language. Several mentors have proven adept
 at taking standardized exams like the SAT and GRE, and enjoy coaching
 individuals preparing for these.</p>
<p>Mentors typically work with students one-to-one or in small groups.
 Because our roster for many subjects includes several qualified
 individuals, we are often able to select a mentor especially suited to
 the needs of a particular student or group. Mentors travel to students'
 homes and schools, or meet with them at Magic or other mutually convenient
 places.</p>

<h1><em>Movement Magic℠</em></h1>
<img class=""picframe fright vert"" src=""/images/fixbike.jpg""/>
<p>Many of us have been sedentary since early childhood. If we begin to
 walk, run, swim, or bicycle for fitness, we often lack awareness
 requisite to moving well. A skilled trainer can guide us in learning to
 move with effectiveness and ease. Hundreds of diverse people—young and
 old, elite athlete and severely limited—who have realized their
 aspirations to swim, run, or bicycle better, or simply to do these
 things at all, during more than a quarter century of <em>Movement Magic℠</em>
 bear witness to this.</p>
<p><em>Movement Magic℠</em> participants benefit from an
 ecological approach in which <em>Magic</em> instructors integrate
 principles of physics, physiology, and psychology to induce relaxation,
 increase kinesthetic and emotional awareness, and accelerate learning of
 effective technique. In group classes and in one-on-one instruction, students
 progress along unique, individually-tailored paths, where next steps are
 easy
 extensions of skills already mastered.</p>
<p>We offer <em>Movement Magic℠</em> to assist people in becoming
 more adaptive—healthy in a broad sense. Although <em>Magic</em>
 instructors present myriad ideas pertinent to bio-mechanical technique,
 and students consistently develop greater proficiency, most <em>Movement
 Magic℠</em> participants come to view mastery of technique as an
 inevitable consequence, rather than as a primary objective. This shift
 in attitude is born of realization that in learning to move, as in any
 experience, we may find partial answers to questions like: ""Who am
 I?"" ""To what purposes do I live?"" and ""How do I know
 these things?""</p>
<p>More accurate perceptions of how we are, why we are this way, and how
 else we might be are both a benefit of, and a prerequisite to many kinds
 of successful adaptation. With such meta-learning we become better able to
 challenge and overthrow maladaptive habits of a lifetime to produce deep
 and lasting change.
 Many
 <em>Movement Magic℠</em> participants report dramatic positive
 shifts in attitude, greater satisfaction at work and play, and better
 relationships with people in many spheres of their lives.</p>
<p><em>Movement Magic℠</em> is sustained by voluntary gift.
 Current instruction is funded by those who have learned before.
 Participants are invited to contribute so that others may benefit as
 they have.</p>

<h2><a name=""introduction""></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>Thank you for you interest in <em>Magic's</em> residential community.
 We've written this pamphlet to explain what we're aiming to do and be here,
 and why as you and we plan towards your possible visit.</p>
<p>Since 1979, we have opened <em>Magic</em> to more than <span id=""2009"" name=""expires"">five
 hundred</span> different overnight guests, and to more than three thousand
 individuals who came to share food and conversation, or to participate
 in educational and service activities sponsored by the public benefit
 organization with which we are affiliated, and with which we share our
 name. On the basis of these experiences we have assembled the following
 information and guidelines to respond to inquiries, and to enable visitors
 to be here in a way that is enjoyable and beneficial for you and for
 us.</p>
<img alt="""" class=""fleft picframe horiz"" src=""/images/373-1.jpg""/>
<p>Please read carefully what we have written here, and be conscientious
 in cooperating with others here during your stay. Your host or hostess
 will answer your questions.</p>
<p>We hope that you will find us good company. Thoughtful guests have contributed
 to our lives in countless ways, and we look forward with pleasure to each
 new visitor.</p>
<h2><a name=""how""></a>How We Are</h2>
<p>We generate our community from shared values. In this section we describe
 some ideas we hold in common, which serve as a foundation for our venture;
 we outline our organizational framework and our ways of making decisions
 together; and we discuss some elements of daily life here which we consider
 to be of central importance.</p>
<h2><a name=""ideas""></a>Ideas</h2>We live together so that we may more
 easily develop deep friendships with each other. We seek such closeness
 because we recognize that each of us has uncritically and even
 unconsciously accumulated many ways of being, and we want each other's
 assistance in becoming more aware. We practice observing ourselves, each
 other, and the world around us to see afresh, and communicating our
 perceptions honestly, openly, and with care.</div>"
21,Liveable City,city,"<div class=""main"">
<h1>Liveable City</h1>
<p><em>Magic's</em> Liveable City project was launched in the mid-1970's to develop and implement an ecological approach to community planning, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>an analysis of local and distant consequences of different patterns of land use and human activity,</li>
<li>a vision for reshaping cities and towns to improve the quality of human life, now and in the future, and</li>
<li>a strategy for realizing that vision by combining advocacy with direct action.</li>
</ul>
<p>Participants in Liveable City have performed extensive research,
 taught classes and workshops, written and distributed software to enable
 simulation of planning decisions, lobbied legislators and administrators
 at local, state, and federal levels, and presented papers at state,
 national, and international conferences. Perhaps most importantly, we
 have engaged in a number of innovative demonstration projects, each of
 which serves as an example of citizen-driven, ecologically-based
 community planning. Though our activities have been centered in Palo
 Alto and other San Francisco Peninsula communities, our influence has
 extended far afield. Over the past <span id=""2015"" name=""expires"">three</span> decades our software and published materials have
 been distributed worldwide, and hundreds of foreign and out-of-state
 visitors have viewed our project sites.</p>
<p>Some of our successes include changing portions of the Palo Alto Comprehensive Plan, securing a pavement shading standard for street tree management in Palo Alto, excluding through traffic from the Evergreen Park neighborhood, establishing native trees and understorey plants along riparian corridors and on public and private openspace lands, founding and operating a low-income housing cooperative, and distributing twenty-five thousand fruit trees to children for planting.</p>
<p>We are currently laboring to improve safety of residential neighborhood streets, to plant and care for urban trees, to win adoption of stormwater resource management policies which rely upon restoring elements of the natural hydrologic cycle, and to abate unnecessary noise from leaf blowers, train horns, emergency vehicle sirens, back-up beepers, and other sources. We welcome collaborators in learning and in teaching how all of us may contribute to a better future.</p>

</div>
<p>In 1980, about a decade before Stanford University celebrated its first
 centennial, <em>Magic</em> began working in partnership with the university's
 biology faculty and planning staff to restore stable oak populations on
 the foothills which rise to the southwest of the central campus.</p>
<p>We pursue this work with two purposes. First, we are seeking to enhance
 the integrity of the foothills ecosystem. Second we are aiming to provide
 opportunities for people who want to learn about ecology by protecting
 and restoring the life-supporting qualities of the environment on which
 all of us depend. To date we have established more than
 two thousand healthy young oaks. Thousands of volunteers
 have contributed
 to make
 this success possible.</p>
<img class=""fleft picframe vert"" src=""/images/treeplant-2.jpg""/>
<p>Every week crews ranging in size from a handful to several dozen volunteers
 take to the field. We hold regular work sessions each Saturday from 9 a.m.
 until noon during cooler months, and at least one weekday evening for two
 hours during warmer months. We also make special arrangements to
 accommodate groups of four or more,
 or
 individuals
 who
 commit to work
 on
 a regular
 basis for
 a minimum of two hours per week during an entire academic quarter.</p>
<p>Tasks vary seasonally, and include planting, mulching, watering, suppressing
 unwanted vegetation, propagating and transplanting native understorey species,
 repairing fences and other tree protection, collecting acorns, and surveying
 the condition of young and mature oaks. Throughout the year we also provide
 office, research, and public outreach opportunities for those who prefer
 to serve in these ways.</p>
<p>People volunteer with <em>Magic</em> to meet new friends, learn about
 ecology, enjoy the out-of-doors, and give a bit of themselves to make the
 world a better place for everyone. Many students find <em>Planting for
 the Second Hundred Years</em> an enjoyable and informative way to satisfy
 public service, action project, or internship requirements. A number have
 successfully
 integrated
 volunteer activity with independent study or research for which they received
 additional academic credit. If you want to lend your heart, head, and hands
 to make Magic with us, we look forward to hearing from you.</p>

<h2> </h2>
<h2><a name=""introduction""></a>Introduction</h2>
<p><em>Magic</em> demonstrates how people can apply scientific methods 
 and principles to further common interests of humankind. We term this practice
 valuescience. Currently, we're using it to become healthier and more aware,
 to cooperate for mutual benefit, and to protect and restore the environment.</p>
<img class=""picframe fleft vert"" src=""/images/chris-1.jpg""/>
<p>In this description we portray <em>Magic</em> as three interrelated entities:
 a service community, which includes all who conduct or support <em>Magic</em> activities;
 a residential program, whose participants live and to varying degrees work
 together to develop our own and <em>Magic's</em> capacities
 for contributing to a common good; and a public benefit, charitable
 corporation, which provides
 a legal framework for <em>Magic</em>.</p>
<p>Ours is an integrated enterprise, in which contexts are merged and roles
 are fluid. Here lines between home, school, workplace, and recreational
 facility, and between family, friends, and professional colleagues are
 rarely easy
 to discern. Many at <em>Magic</em> wear several hats. A Resident may also
 be an Intern or an Officer. A Project Manager in one sphere may be a client
 in another.</p>
<p>We operate <em>Magic</em> to encourage individual creativity and initiative
 in expressing shared values and attaining common goals. We make decisions
 in an open, flexible, and consensual manner. We allocate authority and
 responsibility, power and accountability to enhance personal freedom and
 to apply the resources entrusted to us to further public
 interest.</p>
<p>We are finding a <em>Magic</em> way, one by which we intend to show how
 people may learn to care more effectively for ourselves, for each other,
 and for the Earth. As you read this description, please consider how
 you might enjoy making <em>Magic</em> with us.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2><a name=""summary""></a>Summary</h2>
<p>Who makes <em>Magic</em>? Some call us the Magicians. And here we are, the whole gamut, from occasional client to full-time volunteer.</p>
<h4><a name=""scommunity""></a>Community</h4>
<p>We think of everyone who serves or is served through <em>Magic</em> as part of our community. Past and present clients have included thousands of individuals, non-profit organizations, businesses, and government agencies. <em>Magic's</em> fees are based upon ability to pay, and may include work exchange or other barter. Many clients are served without charge. Clients who pay for <em>Magic's</em> services generate more than half of the corporation's money income. Fee revenues are applied first to the costs of the programs to which they are paid, then to fund other <em>Magic</em> services.</p>
<p>Philanthropic donors provide some of the wealth which flows through <em>Magic</em> to
 benefit the general public. Since its founding <em>Magic</em> has enjoyed
 the generosity of thousands of individual and institutional donors. Because
 so many invest in <em>Magic</em> without being asked, we've been able
 to devote more resource to direct service and less to fundraising than
 is typical. Volunteers carry out nearly all tasks
 entailed
 in
 operating <em>Magic</em>, from maintaining records and capital plant, to
 providing services directly to the public. Donors who give money or goods
 leverage labor of volunteers, enabling us to serve more effectively.</p>
<h5>Affiliates — regularly give labor, money, or material.</h5>
<p>Affiliates are individual and institutional donors who pledge annual contributions
 to <em>Magic</em> of at least ten hours of volunteer labor or at least
 fifty dollars. Some make single contributions and others contribute monthly,
 quarterly, or even weekly. Affiliates receive newsletters, project notes
 and notices of upcoming events, and
 are given
 preference
 in enrolling
 in <em>Magic</em> programs.
 As Affiliates increase their commitment to <em>Magic</em> they often take
 a more active part in developing policies and programs.</p>
<h5>Project Managers — organize others to execute a project.</h5>
<p>Project Managers are skilled individuals, familiar with <em>Magic's</em> operations, who assume major responsibility for organizing others to complete a project or a major phase of one. Usually they commit to serve for at least one year.</p>
<h5>Advisors — provide special expertise.</h5>
<p>Advisors are volunteers with special skills or other attributes applicable
 to developing or operating <em>Magic's</em> organizational structure or
 its programs. By being on-call as needed, Advisors broaden and deepen the
 experience
 and talent available to operate <em>Magic</em> day-to-day.</p>
<h5>Associates — semi-autonomously deliver <em>Magic</em> services.</h5>
<p>Associates operate with substantial independence. They may solicit gifts in the name of <em>Magic</em> to support their work. They manage their projects to generate net income to <em>Magic</em>. Associates' maximum personal compensation, and that of anyone whom they employ with monies which flow through <em>Magic</em>, are limited by current policy to the median income in the area where they live.</p>
<h5>Interns — are a hybrid of donor and client.</h5>
<p>Interns support <em>Magic</em> with their labor while receiving on-the-job training. <em>Magic</em> offers
 a wide range of internships tailored to accommodate individual commitment
 and competence. Interns may perform organizational and facilities maintenance
 tasks, serve as teaching assistants, do research in libraries or in the
 field, and otherwise assist in delivering programs.</p>
<h4><a name=""sresidence""></a>Residence</h4>
<p>Since <em>Magic's</em> founding, we've conducted a residential education
 program whose participants are among the organization's primary beneficiaries
 and its most stalwart servants.</p>
<h5>Residents — live at <em>Magic</em>; model applied valuescience.</h5>
<p>Residents conduct an experiment in intentional community aimed at demonstrating
 the benefits to humankind of applying science to address individual health
 and awareness, social peace and justice, and environmental protection and
 stewardship.
 Residents contribute a combination of labor and money. They share responsibility
 for the development and operation of <em>Magic</em>, including delivery
 of many of its programs. Residents devote substantial life to practices
 aimed at enhancing their capacity for service to humankind.</p>
<h5>Fellows — oversee development and delivery of programs.</h5>
<p>Fellows volunteer full-time at <em>Magic</em>, delivering and supervising
 others in delivering <em>Magic</em> programs. They live at <em>Magic's</em> headquarters
 at the convenience of <em>Magic</em> and usually have their basic needs
 for food, shelter, clothing met by <em>Magic</em>. They also may have
 some medical care, transportation, and communication expenses reimbursed
 by <em>Magic</em>.</p>
<h4><a name=""scorporation""></a>Corporation</h4>
<p><em>Magic</em> is organized as a public benefit corporation dedicated
 to developing and disseminating valuescience in service of common good.</p>
<h5>Directors — are ultimately responsible for <em>Magic</em>.</h5>
<p>Directors oversee corporate operations to ensure that <em>Magic's</em> resources
 are utilized to public benefit. The full Board usually meets for business
 once every few months, but individual Board Members are actively engaged
 in developing <em>Magic</em> programs on a day-to-day basis. Directors are volunteers. They serve for one year and elect their own successors.</p>
<h5>Officers — maintain <em>Magic</em> as an organization.</h5>
<p>The President, Vice-President, Secretary, and Treasurer establish and
 operate systems to support the delivery of program services. They make
 regular reports to oversight agencies, keep minutes of Board meetings,
 make accurate records of legal and financial transactions, oversee maintenance
 of physical plant and equipment, and ensure that <em>Magic</em> remains in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2><a name=""community""></a>Community</h2>
<p>The <em>Magic</em> service community includes all who are touched by the
 organization's activities. We who regularly contribute labor, material,
 and money to enable <em>Magic</em> to demonstrate how the methods and principles
 of valuescience can be applied to better the condition of humankind enjoy
 a close and satisfying fellowship.</p>
<h4><a name=""affiliates""></a>Affiliates</h4>
<p>Affiliates commit ongoing support to <em>Magic</em>. By promising and
 making regular contributions, Affiliates enhance <em>Magic's</em> capacity
 to address issues too large or complex to be quickly resolved. They reduce
 the burdens of fundraising, and of contingency planning to accommodate
 fluctuating resource availability. And they contribute to evolution of <em>Magic</em> as
 a community of friends in service.</p>
<h5>Responsibilities and Rewards</h5>
<p>There are three types of Affiliation, each designed to facilitate expression and recognition of a different degree of engagement.</p>
<p>Affiliate Sponsors annually pledge to <em>Magic</em> at least one thousandth
 of their income, or $50, or 10 hours of volunteer service. They are regularly
 informed of <em>Magic</em> events
 and activities in which they have expressed interest. Operating personnel
 aim to afford Sponsors at least one opportunity each year to pose questions
 and offer suggestions about <em>Magic's</em> structure, philosophy, and policies,
 and about delivery of its programs.</p>
<p>Affiliate Patrons promise yearly gifts of at least 1% of their income,
 or $400, or 60 hours of volunteer service. To address concerns they deem
 pressing, Patrons are invited to confer with operating personnel at least
 once each month and are given preference in enrolling in, and subscribing
 to <em>Magic</em> programs and services.</p>
<p>Affiliate Partners give each year at least 10% of their income, or $3000,
 or 200 hours of service. Partners may actively shape the <em>Magic</em> vision,
 organization, and programs. They typically confer with operating personnel
 at least monthly, though some prefer only infrequent contact. They may
 enroll or subscribe on a preferential basis to <em>Magic</em> programs
 and services.</p>
<h5>Advisors and Project Managers</h5>
<p>Advisors are Affiliates who bring specialized skill and experience to
 the operation of the corporation or the delivery of its programs. Technical
 expertise and established relationships in communities where <em>Magic</em> serves are examples of resources Advisors bring.</p>
<p>Project Managers are qualified Affiliates who undertake responsibility for the successful completion of a major segment or phase of a <em>Magic</em> program. They also may direct the completion of a major task or project necessary to maintain or improve <em>Magic's</em> organizational structure or operations.</p>
<h5>Becoming an Affiliate</h5>
<p>A person may become an Affiliate by fulfilling terms set forth above.
 Advisors are invited to serve by the Fellows, who accept nominations from
 any source. Project Managers are selected by the Fellow responsible for
 the project, in consultation with other project team personnel.</p>
<h4><a name=""associates""></a>Associates</h4>
<p>Associates take full responsibility for a project conducted under the auspices of <em>Magic</em>. Associates are entrepreneurs who expand the breadth of <em>Magic's</em> offerings and increase the population it serves.</p>
<h5>Responsibilities and Rewards</h5>
<p>Associates operate with a great deal of flexibility. They may solicit volunteers and contributions in <em>Magic's</em> name to support their project. They decide when, where, and how to work.</p>
<p>Associates are encouraged to identify themselves with <em>Magic</em>,
 and to inform others of the corporate philosophy and programs. However,
 they act and speak on behalf of the corporation, rather than as individuals
 associated with it, only to the extent specifically authorized by the Fellows.</p>
<p>With each additional Associate's perspective, the qualities of the <em>Magic</em> work
 environment, and of its public service become richer. By diversifying <em>Magic's</em> activities,
 Associates can contribute substantially to the organization's stability,
 insulating it against unforeseen difficulty, and broadening its base of
 support.</p>
<p>Income generated through Associate activities is usually paid directly
 to <em>Magic</em>. Direct costs incurred by <em>Magic</em> and attributable
 to a specific Associate program are charged against income. <em>Magic</em> recovers
 indirect costs by levying a percentage (typically between 10 and 50 percent)
 of income. This amount is adjusted at least once per year to reflect true
 costs. <em>Magic</em> also
 charges a fixed amount (typically ~$500) to cover the one-time expenses
 of establishing a new Associate.</p>
<p>After <em>Magic</em> has been reimbursed for the expenses itemized above, remaining income is available to the Associate as reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses, as personal compensation, or to expand and improve program activities. Rates of personal compensation are limited to the median wage in the area where the Associate resides.</p>
<p>Associate status is designed to combine the advantages of several other courses of action. Enjoying much of the liberty of the independent practicing professional, Associates also benefit from the close support of others who share their values. Stimulated by many of the same opportunities for personal achievement as any entrepreneur, they also may enjoy the satisfaction of acting charitably.</p>
<p>Associates operate with the benefit of <em>Magic's</em> name recognition
 and history of outstanding service. They also are given easy access to
 our growing network of supporters. <em>Magic</em> provides a fiscally and
 organizationally sound framework for people who share a commitment to valuescience,
 and to realizing their own potential through service to others.</p>
<p>Associates bear only a fraction of the expenses of maintaining a public
 benefit corporation, and thus reduce both their personal outlays, and the
 amount of common
 wealth, devoted to transaction costs. Among services available through <em>Magic</em> are
 mail, phone, meeting and workspace, information processing, desktop publishing,
 accounting, legal, insurance, regulatory compliance, and banking.</p>
<p>Perhaps more importantly, Associates are immersed in a learning environment,
 where the foremost objectives are service to others and increased personal
 satisfaction through the conscious practice of valuescience. Because they
 are in close contact with other <em>Magic</em> personnel
 who share their values and who often possess skills complementary to their
 own, Associates
 are able to find more easily the advice and assistance they need to carry
 forward their work in a satisfying and generous way. Associates receive
 preferential access to <em>Magic</em> programs.</p>
<h5>Conflict of Interest</h5>
<p>Because Associates may retain separate professional practices independent of <em>Magic</em>, and because their skills may overlap with those of others who provide services through the corporation, they may experience conflict of interest. Successful Associates bring benefits to the general public, to <em>Magic</em>, and to themselves. <em>Magic</em> asks that Associates be scrupulous in avoiding displacement of other <em>Magic</em> programs as they solicit clients and support, both for their work at <em>Magic</em> and for their other professional activities.</p>
<h5>Becoming an Associate</h5>
<p>Prospective Associates submit a brief proposal to a <em>Magic</em> Fellow.
 In this document they outline their lifeplan, the nature of the service
 they intend to provide through <em>Magic</em>, their qualifications, and
 the reasons they perceive <em>Magic</em> to be an appropriate vehicle.
 If the initial proposal is favorably received, the prospective Associate
 develops a work plan and budget in consultation with the Fellows. These
 documents include specific service objectives, written in terms of program
 content and audience, estimates of income and expenses, and a schedule
 of activities. The relationship between <em>Magic</em> and the Associate
 is detailed, so that both parties are aware of what is being offered and
 asked. The expanded proposal, with work plan and budget, is forwarded by
 the Fellows to the Board of Directors who grant an Associate appointment
 or suggest an alternative course of action.</p>
<h4><a name=""interns""></a>Interns</h4>
<p>Interns work through <em>Magic</em> in order to learn how to apply the methods and principles of ecology to public service. Interns learn how they may become healthier and more satisfied, how they may work more cooperatively with others, and how they may steward the environment. Though often young or relatively inexperienced, Interns have made valuable contributions to <em>Magic</em>,
 and to those it serves.</p>
<h5>Responsibilities and Rewards</h5>
<p>Interns are exposed to the internal workings of a unique, non-sectarian
 residential community founded on the principles that working for common
 good can be a path to personal fulfillment, and that valuescience
 provides
 an
 underpinning
 for effective service. Each Intern is guided by a mentor drawn from the
 ranks of experienced <em>Magic</em> personnel.</p>
<p>Depending upon prior experience, Interns may do everything from cooking and cleaning, to writing and editing, to building and gardening, to teaching and researching. They may work relatively independently or with close supervision. Internship commitments range from a few hours per week to the equivalent of full-time employment, and may extend from a month or so to more than a year. Whatever the extent of their promises, <em>Magic</em> asks that Interns be conscientious in fulfilling them.</p>
<h5>Becoming an Intern</h5>
<p><em>Magic</em> lists internship opportunities with secondary schools, colleges, and volunteer recruitment agencies. Sometimes prospective Interns make inquiry directly. Application procedures vary with internship, applicant, and mentor, and may entail writing and personal interviews. An internship is established when a <em>Magic</em> Fellow approves a contract between a mentor and a prospective Intern. We encourage interns to exchange written performance reviews with their mentor at least once each quarter.</p>
<h2><a name=""residence""></a>Residence</h2>
<p><em>Magic</em> owns and operates three adjacent residences on approximately
 one-half acre of land in Palo Alto, Calfornia. This property serves as
 corporate
 headquarters.
 A residential educational program conducted here is central to <em>Magic's</em> operations.</p>
<h4><a name=""residents""></a>Residents</h4>
<p>People live and work together at <em>Magic</em> to learn to identify and
 further common interests of humankind. Life at <em>Magic</em> is focused
 upon demonstrating how valuescience may be applied
 across a full spectrum of everyday activities to develop individual potential,
 to shape a more cooperative society, and to steward the environment.</p>
<h5>Responsibilities and Rewards</h5>
<p>Residents enter into three contracts. The first is a Social Contract,
 a handful of general precepts which serve as a foundation for living in
 satisfaction, and for contributing to the satisfaction of others, both
 within and beyond the residential program. The second is Guidelines
 for Living at <em>Magic</em> which embodies conventions developed over
 time to facilitate smooth functioning of the community. The third is
 a Residential Program Agreement which lists contribution of labor,
 money, or other tangibles on which residency is conditioned. Most Residents
 contribute an additional 200 hours of labor or $3,000 each year to qualify
 as Affiliate Partners. The terms of each Residential Program Agreement
 are negotiated by Fellow and Resident.</p>
<p>Demonstrating valuescience for benefit of the general public can be
 a challenging task, and becoming more competent to do so can be intensely
 satisfying. Residents
 are
 constrained in the material aspects of living, and they give substantially
 to public service activities aimed at betterment of the human condition.
 They are extensively supported in aligning their lives with their deepest
 values, and they enjoy both obvious and more subtle benefits of modeling
 valuescience-informed service. A chief aim of the Residential Program is
 to show that living to further common good can be joyful.</p>
<h5>Becoming a Resident</h5>
<p><em>Magic</em> is an enterprise in which harmonious personal relationships
 are a foundation for successfully meeting broad public service objectives
 with limited resources. Prospective Residents are encouraged to become
 well-acquainted with <em>Magic's</em> programs and personnel by studying
 the website, visiting, and volunteering.</p>
<p>Applicants for residency discuss with a Fellow how they imagine benefitting
 from residency and contributing through <em>Magic</em>. If prospect and
 Fellow agree to move forward, they arrange meetings with other Residents.
 After these, the Fellow may draft a Residential
 Program Agreement in consultation with the applicant, or propose another
 arrangement.</p>
<h4 id=""fellows"">Fellows</h4>
<p>Fellows are experienced teachers and persistent learners, who demonstrate
 through the example of their own lives how ecology may be a basis for effective
 service of the common good.Current fellows have served through <em>Magic</em> for
 decades. <a href=""whoweare"">(List
 of current fellows)</a></p>
<h5>Responsibilities and Rewards</h5>
<p>Fellows are full-time volunteers who contract to serve <em>Magic</em> at least forty hours per week for a period of one year or longer, qualifying them as Affiliate Partners. The Directors have delegated to the Fellows day-to-day responsibility for guiding the development and delivery of <em>Magic's</em> programs. In some instances Fellows conduct programs themselves, and in others they supervise Project Managers, Residents, Affiliates, Interns, and others. Fellows are given primary responsibility for relationships with Associates, proposing association with <em>Magic</em> to them or responding to their initiatives, and consulting with them in the conduct of their projects. Fellows also provide direction to the Officers, who develop and maintain <em>Magic's</em> material and organizational infrastructure to properly support existing and anticipated programs.</p>
<p>Fellows reside at <em>Magic</em> at the request of the Directors.
 Usually their basic needs for food and shelter are met by <em>Magic</em>,
 and their clothing, medical care, transportation, and communication expenses
 may be defrayed in whole or in part by <em>Magic</em>. <em>Magic</em> policy also provides for comparable support
 for one minor or other dependent of each Fellow.</p>
<h5>Becoming a Fellow</h5>
<p>Fellows are required to evidence deep understanding of valuescience, and
 broad competence in demonstrating how people may more effectively care
 for 
 self,
 for others, and for the air, land, water, and diverse species on which
 the quality of human life depends.</p>
<p>Fellowship applications are submitted to an existing Fellow. Applications
 include a lifeplan outline, specifying the applicant's goals and anticipated
 activities, their qualifications and limitations as they perceive them,
 and what they aim to offer and obtain at <em>Magic</em>. Applications are
 circulated among Fellows, Residents, Affiliate Partners, and Associates
 for comment. If review is favorable, the Fellow who accepted the application
 may forward it to the Directors with a recommendation for action. The Directors
 may offer a provisional appointment of one to several months. During this
 interval, the applicant participates at <em>Magic</em> under the direction
 of an existing Fellow. At the end of the trial period, either the provisional
 appointment is extended, or the applicant is offered a regular appointment
 for one year, or an alternative affiliation with <em>Magic</em> is proposed.</p>
<p>The performance of each Fellow is reviewed by other Fellows at least
 quarterly, and the by the Board of Directors at least once per year. A
 Fellow may be reappointed
 at any time for a term of one year, or for another period equal to or shorter
 than the tenure of service of that Fellow at the time of reappointment.</p>

<h2><a name=""corporation""></a>Corporation</h2>
<p>Much about <em>Magic</em> was decided by the founders when they chartered
 a corporation to research and teach human ecology for the
 benefit of the general public. <em>Magic's</em> assets and the activities
 carried out in its name are dedicated to this purpose, since amended to
 specifically mandate development and dissemination of valuescience.</p>
<p>As a public benefit corporation <em>Magic</em> has a structure familiar
 to many in our society. This enables diverse individuals and institutions
 to interact
 more comfortably with us.</p>
<p><em>Magic</em> is regulated by several government agencies. We make annual
 reports, itemizing our income and expenses, and outlining our programs
 and services, to the Santa Clara County Assessor, the Attorney General
 of the State of California, the California Secretary of State, the Internal
 Revenue Service of the United States, and the California Franchise Tax
 Board, all of whom oversee our activities to make certain that they conform
 to our stated purpose, and are in compliance with applicable law.</p>
<h4><a name=""directors""></a>Directors</h4>
<p>Directors are empowered by <em>Magic's</em> by-laws to oversee the operation of the corporation. They are selected for their understanding of the analysis and vision underpinning <em>Magic</em>, and for their record of public service. They bring with them a diversity of experience and other resources by which to enhance the stability and enable the growth of <em>Magic</em>.</p>
<h5>Responsibilities and Rewards</h5>
<p>Directors pledge at least 200 hours of service or 10% of their income
 or $3000 annually to <em>Magic</em>, qualifying them as Affiliate Partners.
 They enjoy the satisfaction of collaborating with a group of people who
 are founding lives of service upon valuescience. To facilitate harmonious
 and cooperative pursuit of the corporation's public service objectives,
 they
 sustain close
 relationships with <em>Magic's</em> other key personnel.</p>
<p>Directors are legally responsible for operation of the corporation in
 accordance with its charitable purpose. They serve without pay and are
 prohibited by law from entering into transactions with <em>Magic</em> which result in pecuniary gain to them. Unless they act diligently to ensure that <em>Magic's</em> resources are prudently and unwaveringly applied to contribute to the welfare of the general public, Directors may be held accountable in civil or criminal proceedings.</p>
<p>Directors elect their own successors, and they elect Officers. In consultation with other personnel, they select Associates and Fellows. Full Board meetings are held at least once per year. At the annual meeting, the Directors review reports describing the development and operation of <em>Magic's</em> programs and infrastructure during the prior year, and outlining plans for the coming year. Special meetings of the full Board are scheduled as required during the year. These may be separated by weeks or months. Meetings of Board committees and between individual Directors and other personnel are more frequent.</p>
<h5>Becoming a Director</h5>
<p><em>Magic</em> Directors: (1) understand the fundamentals of valuescience
 and its broad applicability, (2) view their own self-interest to include
 the well-being of other people,
 other
 life, and the abiotic environmental factors upon which life depends, (3)
 embrace a vision of <em>Magic</em> as a model of valuescience-based service
 community, (4) perceive that they can contribute to the fuller realization
 of that vision, and (5) commit to actively participate in shaping <em>Magic</em>.</p>
<p>Directors nominate themselves, often at the request of others associated
 with the corporation. Nominees are asked to submit a statement describing
 how they imagine serving on the Board will benefit them and <em>Magic</em>.
 All nomination papers are addressed to the President, who circulates them
 among Fellows, Affiliate Partners, Associates, and Residents for comment,
 and forwards them to the Board for action. The Board decides by majority
 vote
 whether
 to seat a nominee.</p>
<h4><a name=""officers""></a>Officers</h4>
<p>Officers administer <em>Magic</em> to enable development and delivery of program services for the benefit of the general public.</p>
<h5>Responsibilities and Rewards</h5>
<p>Officers pledge 200 hours of service or 10% of their income or $3000 annually, qualifying them as Affiliate Partners. The Directors have delegated to the Officers responsibilty for implementing Board policies pertinent to maintaining <em>Magic's</em> organizational infrastructure, and for operating it in a manner which complies with applicable federal, state, and local law. Officers may delegate tasks and supervise others in fulfilling them as they deem appropriate.</p>
<p>The President convenes and conducts Board meetings, executes contracts
 with personnel, clients, and vendors, files oversight agency reports, and
 oversees other officers in performing their duties.</p>
<p>The Vice-president manages physical plant and equipment, including real property, vehicles, computers, tools, and supplies.</p>
<p>The Secretary makes complete and accurate minutes of Board meetings, retains
 custody of the corporate seal and affixes it as necessary, and manages
 informational resources, including current operating policies and protocols,
 presentation documents, records of past activities, and a database of affiliated
 personnel.</p>
<p>The Treasurer manages corporate financial assets, keeps complete and accurate financial records, drafts and updates operating plans and budgets, and prepares quarterly and annual financial reports.</p>
<p>Officers are volunteers. In addition to their organizational support duties,
 they may undertake direct responsibility for delivering <em>Magic</em> programs.
 If their role warrants, they may reside at <em>Magic</em> at
 the request of the corporation. When they do, their basic expenses for
 food and shelter may be met by the corporation. Under some circumstances,
 their clothing, medical care, transportation, and communication expenses
 also may be defrayed in full or in part by <em>Magic</em>.</p>
<h5>Becoming an Officer</h5>
<p>Officers are appointed by a majority of the Board for one-year terms. They may nominate themselves or be nominated by others. Nominations are submitted to the President and circulated among the Affiliate Partners, Associates, and Fellows for comment before being forwarded to the Board. The performance of the Officers is reviewed at least quarterly by the Fellows.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2><a name=""operations""></a>Operations</h2>
<p><em>Magic</em> is operated to provide satisfaction to those who contribute
 to its work, and to apply resources entrusted to its care to further
 human well-being.</p>
<h4><a name=""authority""></a>Authority</h4>
<p>The Board delegates to the Fellows, Associates, Interns, and those Affiliates who contribute labor the authority to carry <em>Magic</em> forward on a day-to-day basis. Under normal circumstances, operating personnel decide where and how to commit <em>Magic</em> assets, whether they be money, material, or labor. They also determine who shall act on behalf of the corporation, and in what capacity.</p>
<p>Although all operating personnel are responsible for maintenance of corporate infrastructure, each person retains considerable freedom to choose what other activities personally to undertake, and how to conduct them. People specialize both by formal and by informal arrangement. We accommodate and appreciate diversity, and we also cultivate unity.</p>
<p>We allocate corporate resources with respect to three principles:
(1) equality, because we perceive benefit in fully considering each person; (2) equity, to acknowledge those who have been diligent in the past and are committed for the future; and (3) effectiveness, so that people with expertise and skill may contribute them fully.</p>
<p>Individuals may freely express their ideas about their work with <em>Magic</em>, but they may write, speak, or otherwise communicate on behalf of <em>Magic</em> only when authorized to do so by action of the Board, or when acting with the approval of someone so authorized. The Officers and other operating personnel are delegated varying degrees of authority to represent <em>Magic</em>.</p>
<p>Operating personnel regularly evaluate each other, so that all of us may learn to see ourselves and each other more clearly. We generally set aside a few minutes daily, several hours weekly, and several days each quarter for planning and review. Directors and others connected to <em>Magic</em> sometimes participate in these activities.</p>
<h4><a name=""spirit""></a>Spirit</h4>
<p>People remain joined together as <em>Magic</em> because we perceive developinhg
 and disseminating valuscience for common good, to be consistent with our
 personal ideas about how to live well, and because we see advantage
 in organizing
 for
 cooperative
 action
 within
 the
 framework of this public benefit corporation.</p>
<p>The people at <em>Magic</em> who participate in developing organizational
 philosophy and policy, or in operating service programs, consider valuescience
 to be animportant tool for increasing human well-being. We also
 share a
 perception, based in our own valuescience practices, that we find greater
 satisfaction
 in learning to love better, than in commanding luxury goods and services.</p>
<p>Our material rewards, if we receive any, are modest by contrast to what we might reap, or have already experienced in other settings. We are motivated by a vision of public service. The standard to which we ask each other to be accountable is one of net service, both to <em>Magic</em>, and to the world beyond.</p>
<p>More than many organizations, <em>Magic</em> is a community of friends.
 Like any description of a group where people collaborate in so many aspects
 of living, the words here are necessarily a very partial picture. <em>Magic</em> is
 steadily changing. As more people contribute, those with greater experience
 are finding new ways to share the pleasures and the responsibilities
 of planning and deciding. The spirit of <em>Magic</em> is increasingly
 one of compassion and understanding.</p>
<h2> </h2>

 the processes by which the corporation is being shaped, you may enjoy visiting
 our headquarters, meeting some of us, and observing or participating in
 the activities by which we maintain <em>Magic's</em> infrastructure and deliver its program services.</p>
<p>Our organizing documents, statements of policy, annual reports, project descriptions, the publications we have produced to support our various programs, and working papers of many kinds are available to the public by appointment at 381 Oxford Avenue, Palo Alto, California, or by mail to those who pay full costs of reproduction, postage, and handling.</p>

<p>What do you think are the consequences of an exponentially growing human population crowding onto a planet increasingly polluted and depleted of resource? Are disappointment and deprivation becoming more persistent and widespread? Are people evidencing mounting fear as we watch our own and our neighbors' dreams, or even life itself, be snatched away?</p>
<img alt="""" class=""fleft picframe vert"" src=""/images/sm-1.jpg""/>
<p>At <em>Magic</em> we perceive that humans are more and more preoccupied with getting what we want, and with protecting against loss, and that we are becoming less and less concerned about giving. We see this shift in attitudes evidenced in diverse phenomena. Much that people once did as family and friends we now undertake as parties to business and governmental transactions. In one aspect of life after another we seek to pay or work as little as we can, and to take away as much as possible; we deliver only what is required, and maneuver to shape law and contract in our favor. With our organized charitable activities we are satisfying a dwindling proportion of need. Even in the shrinking sphere of familial and friendly relationships, many of us are turning added attention to who is getting what.</p>
<h2><a name=""gift""></a>Gift Economy</h2>
<p>Giving without expectation of reciprocity or third-party compensation may be essential to a decent society and to a satisfying life. By giving we care for those, including the unborn, who lack sufficient power to protect themselves. By giving we sustain 'the commons.' By giving we generate the myriad kindnesses too small to warrant the transaction costs of accounting. By giving we teach that which is yet to be commercially valued. By giving we affirm our connectedness to each other, to the rest of the living world, and to the cosmos. Giving is key to transcending the pain of mortality, to dying gracefully. Without giving we shrink into isolation.</p>
<p>A primary purpose of <em>Magic</em> is to be a vehicle for giving. By exploring ways to recreate a more robust gift economy, the people making <em>Magic</em> are seeking to improve individual well-being, to shape a more cooperative society, and to sustain the integrity of the environment upon which all of us depend. Making <em>Magic</em> also entails participation in the commercial economy, and interaction with government. In these realms we aim to counter the trends towards commercialization and command by delivering more than is required, by asking less than is customary, and by increasing consensual, and lessening coercive behavior.</p>
<img class=""picframe fright vert"" src=""/images/fence.jpg""/>
<span id=""2003"" name=""expired""></span>
<h2 id=""income"">Income and Expense</h2>
<p>During the five years from 1998 through 2002 <em>Magic's</em> annual average operating income was: ~$80,000 cash,
~$60,000 in-kind gifts of material, and ~11,000 hours of volunteer labor. With these resources we demonstrated how ecology can be applied to identify and to further common interests of humankind.</p>
<p>More than half of <em>Magic's</em> cash income flows from donations made by recipients of program services. We ask that clients contribute at a rate equivalent to what they earn. A typical suggested hourly rate for <em>Magic</em> services is about one-tenth of one percent of a client's annual earnings. When <em>Magic</em> serves an institution or group, we request that they estimate a mean, and when a team of <em>Magic</em> personnel serve, we ask that clients take this into account. <em>Magic</em> personnel may arrange for clients to give work- or other in-kind support where that is mutually agreeable.</p>
<p>From 1998 through 2002 <em>Magic's</em> annual cash and in-kind expenditures, exclusive of labor, were ~$32,000. In-kind expenditures for operations were ~$23,000. The remainder of in-kind gift we passed through either to program participants, or in exchange for salvaging and processing materials we used in renovating a building acquired in 2001. We rely almost entirely upon volunteers, and have paid less than one percent of <em>Magic's</em> income since inception for salaries, benefits, and contract labor. Key residential program personnel are required to live on-site, and are provided room and board. From 1998-2000 our labor budget averaged ~11,000 person-hours per year. About two-thirds of this was contributed by a handful of volunteers who gave ten or more hours per week. Thanks to the generosity and dedication of such people, the cost for <em>Magic</em> to deliver a person-year of public service has been ~$6,000 cash and about ~$4,000 in-kind.</p>
<p>We are currently investigating how we may restructure <em>Magic</em> to enable full-time volunteers to enjoy a material standard of living comparable to that of a typical U.S. resident. We contemplate compensation based on the U.S. median wage, or support for staff and their dependents based upon U.S. per capita income. With these or similar strategies we imagine making <em>Magic</em> a viable career option, while continuing to attract people who are strongly motivated to public service.</p>
<h2><a name=""assets""></a>Assets and Liabilities</h2>
<p>Over the past fifteen years <em>Magic</em> has accumulated an endowment of a little more than $1 million. Currently this is entirely invested in three adjacent Palo Alto properties which house <em>Magic's</em> programs.</p>
<p><em>Magic</em> owes ~$400,000 to supporters who loaned funds to make possible the purchase of its third property in 2003.</p>
<h2><a name=""promotion""></a>Promotion</h2>
<p><em>Magic</em> has expended less than one percent of its resources on fundraising, grant-writing, and marketing. In part as a result of this, grants from government and foundations have comprised less than five percent of our income. We have relied almost entirely upon word-of-mouth to engage clients and contributors, and have eschewed special events and other common non-profit promotional activities which are aimed primarily at generating income. Most of our in-kind or money gifts have come at the initiative of firms and individuals familiar with our work, although we have sometimes actively solicited to fill a specific need.</p>
<p><em>Magic</em> is a very personal enterprise, which has brought clients, donors, and others together in a community of service. While we realize that greater emphasis upon securing resources might enable the organization to grow more rapidly, we have preferred to devote our attention to improving service quality, and have relied upon publicly acknowledged achievements to elicit additional support.

26,Supporting Magic,support,"<div class=""main"">
<h1>Supporting Magic</h1>
<img class=""picframe fright vert"" src=""/images/daniel-1.jpg""/>
<p>Each year <em>Magic</em> is generously supported by hundreds of volunteers and other donors whose gifts of labor, material, and money typically account for about half of its income. <em>Magic</em> uses these contributions to accomplish work which we consider crucial to human well-being, but which is given short shrift by others. Our programs to demonstrate the benefits of bringing human values into harmony with ecological principle are examples. By their gifts donors evidence understanding that the well-being of any of us is inextricably connected to the well-being of others.</p>
<p><em>Magic</em> derives about half of its income from those who receive its services. We ask people who request <em>Magic</em> services and reap personal benefit from them to contribute something equivalent to what they, themselves earn. Where this will be contrary to public interest we negotiate work- or other in-kind exchange, or waive payment entirely.</p>
<p>A typical suggested donation for an hour of <em>Magic</em> services is approximately one-tenth of one percent of a client's annual earnings. When <em>Magic</em> serves an institution or group, or when a team of <em>Magic</em> personnel deliver services, we request that clients take this into account. By giving to <em>Magic</em>, those whom we serve affirm that they value what they have received, and provide wherewithal for <em>Magic</em> to generate benefit for others.</p>
<p>Donors, clients, and others who appreciate what <em>Magic</em> is and does contribute to its strength by drawing attention to its achievements. Since <em>Magic</em> relies almost entirely upon word-of-mouth to elicit support, all who speak appreciatively of it are critical to our continuing success.</p>
<p>We consider the structure and operation of <em>Magic</em> to be vehicles for demonstrating the principles on which it was founded. By relying heavily upon gift, freely giving many of our services, and cooperatively negotiating fees based upon clients' ability to pay, we aim to exemplify some of the ways that we apply the methods and principles of ecology to discover and to further the common interests of humankind. If you find the model we are developing at <em>Magic</em> worthy, we will welcome all that you do to make it more robust. <em>Magic</em> exists today only because those who associated with it in the past gave to it more than they took away.</p>

<h2><a name=""summary""></a>Program Summary</h2>
<p>In each year from 1990 through 2000, <em>Magic</em> volunteers, assisted by wholesale nursery operators, Whole Foods Market in Palo Alto, and other organizational partners, salvaged thousands of surplus fruit trees, and distributed them through schools and charities for planting throughout the greater San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
<img alt="""" class=""fleft picframe vert"" src=""/images/lynn+oak.jpg""/>
<p>Together we rescued more than 23,000 trees and passed them along to over 15,000 children in more than fifty schools, and to almost two dozen charitable organizations. These trees now grace cities from Santa Rosa to Gonzales, Richmond to Half Moon Bay.</p>
<p>We prepared a written curriculum, as well as planting and care instructions, which classroom teachers or Fruition volunteers present to prospective tree recipients as a condition of their participation in the program.</p>
<p>In follow-up surveys we found 70-95% of Fruition trees successfully established after one year.</p>
<div class=""box fright"" style=""width: 200px;"">
<a href=""fruition/""><img alt=""Fruition: A Fruit Tree Planting"" src=""/images/fruition.jpg""/></a><br/><small>See the Fruition website, with Planting Guide and Curriculum</small>
</div>
<h2><a name=""issues""></a>Issues Addressed</h2>
<p>Through Fruition, people learn about cycling of nutrients and flows of energy through the biosphere by which life on Earth exists.</p>
<p>We find incentive to contemplate different ways in which food is grown and processed, and to consider consequences of each for our and others' well-being.</p>
<p>We reconsider costs and benefits of alternative residential landscape practices.</p>
<p>We experience stewardship in an activity where rewards are direct, albeit requiring some patience.</p>
<p>We draw inspiration to think about the future, and to live more with an eye to making it good for everyone-ourselves, our own families and friends, people in other places, and those yet to be born.</p>
<h4><a name=""choices""></a>Consumer Choices:</h4>
<p>With home orcharding we can shape landscapes which are more environmentally benign than many. If we select plant varieties well-matched to our locale, we may successfully cultivate them without applying manufactured pesticide or nutrient, and without using large quantities of imported water.</p>
<p>We may also avoid other nega-tive environmental impacts of industrial agriculture by bypassing energy-intensive transport and processing, and reducing incentives for open-cycle, non-renewable-resource-depleting, hazardous-substance-dependent methods.</p>
<p>Home growers often sun-dry or can to preserve seasonal surplus for later use. With these methods we typically impose fewer burdensome environmental consequences than we do when we purchase commercially canned or frozen food, or when we transport out-of-season foods. Many people also discover recreational value in orcharding, and displace activities with less positive environmental impact to pursue it.</p>
<h4><a name=""waste""></a>Hazardous Household Waste:</h4>
<p>Lawn and garden care products comprise a major fraction of hazardous household waste. People who eat from a residential landscape are less likely to poison it. Fruition staff have watched individuals expand with sensibilities from a single tree, to a whole property, to the global environment.</p>
<h4><a name=""reduction""></a>Reduction, Reuse, Recycling:</h4>
<p>Recycling of carbon is essential to biospheric stability. Fruit trees on home grounds absorb carbon and trap it in their woody tissues, sometimes for decades. With fruit trees we lessen CO2 build-up (1) by diminishing reliance upon a system of agriculture and food processing in which we capture carbon at one-tenth the rate we release it, and (2) by providing shade and windbreak benefits to cut fuel requirements for space heating or cooling. Trees we salvage are destined to be burned as waste within days, putting the carbon from their tissues into the atmosphere, and degrading air quality with particulates.</p>
<p>People engaged in home orcharding commonly come to recognize kitchen scraps, leaves, and garden clippings as resources and compost them rather than send them to a landfill or incinerator.<br/>In times of drought, fruit trees on home grounds offer strong inducement to capture household waste water (graywater) for irrigation. Finally, with home orcharding we obviate food packaging, much of which is difficult to recycle, and comprises a major component of residential waste.</p>
<h2><a name=""participation""></a>Participation</h2>
<p><em>Magic</em> requested that staff and students at schools participating in Fruition agree to carry out the seven steps outlined here. (We tried to make exceptions where full compliance was difficult.)</p>
<ol>
<li>At least one representative from each school comes to <em>Magic's</em> office in Palo Alto. The purpose of this meeting is to provide background information and curriculum materials, respond to questions, and establish a face-to-face working relationship. If you like, you may return for additional guidance.</li>
<li>A volunteer affiliated with each school contacts local press, takes photographs on distribution day, and sends two copies of news clippings and photographs to <em>Magic</em>. We forward one copy to the wholesale nurseries that donated the trees to thank them for their gift, and retain one for our records.</li>
<li>Teachers in participating classrooms devote a minimum of one hour of class time to presenting the curriculum and preparing students to receive trees.</li>
<li>Teachers distribute commitment slips to children for parents to sign, pledging that they will help their child plant and care for one (or more) trees.</li>
<li>Teachers collect and tally slips, and report to <em>Magic</em> the number of trees for which they have care commitments. We work diligently to provide each student at least one tree. In past years we have met all requests; however <em>Magic</em> cannot guarantee that trees will be available.</li>
<li>School personnel and volunteers recruited by the school community pick-up trees at <em>Magic</em> and distribute them to children.</li>
<li>School representatives collect from one to five dollars per tree, which may be drawn from school funds, student families, or other sources. Amounts in excess of two dollars per tree enable us to serve those who pay less.</li>
<li>With these payments, student families and teachers become more invested in the trees' well-being. We have discovered that payment correlates positively with tree survival. You also communicate to <em>Magic</em> volunteers and to other donors that you value Fruition. Understand, however, that once you have committed to Fruition, we deliver it as well as we are able, regardless of what you later contribute.</li>

<p>Residents typically contribute a combination of labor and money to participate in <em>A Better Home</em>. We share responsibility for the development and operation of <em>Magic</em>, including delivery of many of its services for the benefit of the general public. Three of us, designated Resident Fellows out of respect for the experience we have garnered in the fifteen to twenty-plus years we have devoted to our venture, shoulders an extra measure of teaching, counseling, and strategic planning.</p>
<p><em>A Better Home</em> is a vehicle for service by <em>Magic</em> to we who reside there, to those who visit to participate in <em>Magic</em> programs, and to those who otherwise benefit from the work of the corporation.</p>
<span id=""2009"" name=""expires""></span> <p>Over the past twenty years
 <em>A Better Home</em> has evolved to reflect the contributions of the
 several dozen people who have remained in residence for months or years,
 and the influence of more than two thousand short-term visitors and
 guests from around the country and the world. Currently about a dozen
 adults ranging in age from 20 to 60 and two children born in 1999 live
 together. Former residents and other close associates live within a few
 blocks.</p>
<p>We welcome opportunities to meet new people and to explore how we may interact to mutual advantage-and to further common good. Frequently we do this over our supper table, or in the context of one or another of the programs and projects sponsored by <em>Magic</em>.</p>

</div>
<p>Thoughtful people understand the concept of enough. Even with ""good"" things, like eating or drinking, we admit without equivocation that sometimes less is better.</p>
<p>Most people like being able to work close to home, and to find the products and services we want near at hand. Many also think that business taxes provide net community benefit, more than offsetting the costs businesses impose. But how many jobs, products, services, and business tax dollars are enough? Beyond what point is additional business a liability rather than an asset?</p>
<p>In this report, I respond to these questions by examining how Palo Altans answered when asked what we want, and by analyzing past events, the current situation, and observable trends in Palo Alto and beyond. I conclude that to bring more business and commerce to Palo Alto will be detrimental to Palo Altans, and to people elsewhere.</p>
<p>Palo Alto's city council members are poised to approve a new comprehensive plan which permits, and in some ways promotes, additional business here. We can plan towards a better community by capping business floorspace at current levels, and ""developing"" this sector of our community by making qualitative changes, rather than by adding to it.</p>
<h2><a name=""what""></a>What do Palo Altans want?</h2>
<p>How much of what kinds of business and commerce do we want here, and why? </p>
<p>Palo Altans engage in commerce to secure goods and services and to earn income. Our overarching goal in both of these activities is to make our lives good. Let's take a look at how we're doing?</p>
<h2><a name=""find""></a>Can we find goods and services?</h2>
<p>In the Comprehensive Plan Update Survey, six hundred residents were asked whether they wanted additional retail businesses. A clear majority said, ""No."" Fifty-five percent rejected additional convenience retail and personal service businesses. Three-quarters rejected bulk retail stores. Seventy-two percent rejected more specialty retail stores.</p>
<h2><a name=""jpobs""></a>What about jobs?</h2>
<p>Palo Altans work close to home, and are paid well to do so. There are more than two jobs within the city for every resident member of the work force. More than two-thirds of Palo Altans work less than twenty minutes from home. Nearly two-fifths actually work within Palo Alto. Household and per capita incomes here are more than twice the county mean and median. Fewer than one in twenty residents lives below the poverty line.</p>
<h2><a name=""taxes""></a>Do we want more business because of taxes?</h2>
<p>When asked in the Comprehensive Plan Update Survey whether we needed more office development, more than three-quarters of us said, ""No."" More than two-thirds said, ""No,"" to a new full-service hotel and conference center. By contrast, more than two-thirds called for more parks and open space. When asked, ""Are there other land uses that you think are needed?"" only one in ten respondents said, ""commercial,"" and one in twenty-five replied, ""industrial,"" making these two categories next to last and last, respectively.</p>
<p>But that's not all. Asked, ""What do you like least about living in Palo Alto?"" well over half of the respondents cited ""cost of living and cost of housing,"" ""traffic,"" ""degradation of physical environment,"" and ""problems related to growth and development."" All of these are primarily attributable to business overdevelopment.</p>
<h2><a name=""misinformed""></a>Are residents misinformed?</h2>
<p>Some claim that residents are naive, and that we need more business here to generate tax revenues. I see four flaws in their reasoning:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Tax revenues from business are less than the costs of publicly-supported services to business plus the costs externalized by business. People with commercial interests here are more numerous than residents, making it difficult for residents to avoid losing more through externalities than we gain through taxes. Residents devote thousands of hours each year to fight against projects which will benefit others at our expense.</p>
<p>A local real estate professional estimated the cost of traffic to homeowners on University Avenue to be more than two million dollars per year. Evergreen Park residents bear two thousand dollars a day in externalized commercial parking costs alone. Yet per capita business-generated tax revenues in Palo Alto are less than five hundred dollars per year! </p></li>
<li><p>Disproportionate business here deprives others of a fair share of jobs, access to goods and services, and tax revenue. Palo Alto's per capita revenues are already one and one-half to four times those of comparable cities, and the lack of municipal services in nearby East Palo Alto has cost us millions of dollars directly and indirectly.</p></li>
<li><p>The current system of municipal finance is incompatible with efficient allocation of resource. The authors of ""Bay Vision 2020"" call fiscal zoning a mistake, and reform to defeat it essential. Planning Director Ken Schreiber has warned that such change is coming.</p></li>
<li><p>But perhaps the most important argument against adding business for tax reasons is that put forward in the Economic Future Study drafted by City of Palo Alto staff. The authors of this report see ""no looming problems"" with respect to municipal finance.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2><a name=""destroying""></a>Are we destroying our community?</h2>
<p>These compelling facts about employment, personal incomes, local self-determination, and Palo Alto's fiscal condition, these strong opinions about whether additional goods and services, employment opportunities, or tax revenues are needed, and these perceptions about what is least good about life in Palo Alto are a mandate to halt additional nonresidential construction in this city. They reflect an objectively measurable imbalance in land use here, and a widespread understanding of the negative consequences of that imbalance.</p>
<h2><a name=""doing""></a>So what are we doing about it?</h2>
<p>Precious little. During the past decade the value of commercial and industrial construction permitted in Palo Alto was nearly three-quarters of a billion dollars! And looking forward twenty years, the proposed comprehensive plan will encourage continuation of this trend.</p>
<h2><a name=""wrong""></a>Where did we go wrong?</h2>
<p>In a CPAC Briefing Report, our city staff commented on how we arrived at our current predicament: ""At the root of much of our current environmental crisis is the failure of our economic models…"" If we internalize the full costs of more business here, we will see that it is a very bad bargain indeed. The proposed comprehensive plan reflects its authors' continuing failure to recognize the full costs of business activity. Instead, they have used the pretext of generating tax revenues to fund municipal services as an excuse for planning the continuing expansion of business and commerce, a course which will bring private gain at public expense.</p>
<h2><a name=""price""></a>What price are we paying?</h2>
<p>That many people agree with this analysis is evident. Already individuals are taking their families and businesses away from the Peninsula, accepting lower dollar income to avoid the heavy negative externalities here and to reap the generous positive externalities of less densely settled places. With a steady stream of environmental legislation to limit externalities, lawmakers are accelerating the flight from dense settlement. Planners can repeat the mantra of ""density"" until they turn blue. Ordinary people see and feel the differences that density makes, and overwhelmingly reject it. ""Rebuild L. A."" has proven a difficult and unpopular task. Reinhabiting the countryside is the story of the booming Rockies and Northwest.</p>
<p>Here in Palo Alto, those who are less able or willing to divest their holdings are aiming to gain advantage through land use policies which will permit them to increase the burdens that they place on the rest of us. A comprehensive plan which encourages additional business construction is part of their strategy. If it is approved, our quality of life will continue to spiral downward as unmonetized costs rise faster than monetized benefits. The truth of this is evident in the histories of thousands of cities and towns more intensively built than our own.</p>
<h2><a name=""alternative""></a>Is there an alternative?</h2>
<p>I propose a single alteration to the draft comprehensive plan: change the mushy language which calls for ""a variety of planning and regulatory tools, including growth limits, to ensure that business growth is compatible with the needs of Palo Alto neighborhoods"" to ""Allow no net increase in business and commercial floorspace or pavement in the Palo Alto planning area to ensure that business activity is compatible with the needs and desires of Palo Altans.""</p>
<p>By this simple, readily understood, easily measured standard, we can ensure that future growth of business in our community will be qualitative, rather than quantitative. We allow for redevelopment, including relocation of facilities, and changes to the kinds of enterprise they contain, on the condition that any new construction be offset by an equal amount of demolition or conversion to noncommercial use. We take a huge step towards remedying the ills of business overdevelopment. We respect the will of the residents of Palo Alto. We set a positive example for other communities. And perhaps most importantly, we restructure our business to bring us into greater harmony with the laws of nature, and with our fellow humans who live elsewhere.</p>
<h2><a name=""lead""></a>Shall we lead, or go kicking and screaming?</h2>
<p>The end of growth in human population, human artifact, human-mediated matterenergy throughput, and monetization of human society lie in our future. We can adapt to these important changes by planning a more self-reliant community and contributing to others' ability to do so. If you think the proposal presented in this report is a means to further these ends, please support it.</p>

<h2><a name=""introduction""></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>As more people become familiar with the several experiments in intentional community sponsored by <em>Magic</em>, we are asked with increasing frequency how we have arrived at our present situation, and how we envision developing our communities in the future. We have prepared the following set of questions to serve as a framework for discourse about intentional community as we practice and aspire to it.</p>
<h2><a name=""philosophy""></a>Philosophy</h2>
<ol>
<li>How do you define community? </li>
<li>2. What do you value in community? </li>
<h2><a name=""purpose""></a>Purpose</h2>
<p>1. With what purpose will you become part of another community?
(Please consider the magnitude, duration, and quality of results you intend.)<br/>2. What do you feel is missing from your present situation?<br/>3. How do you want people outside the community you contemplate to think of those within it?</p>
<h2><a name=""resource""></a>Resource</h2>
<p>1. What money or in-kind income do you imagine necessary to meet your community objectives? (e.g. - You want to form a cooperative nursery school for 20 children and imagine 20,000 hours of labor or $300,000 necessary each year.) What assets? (e.g. - You want to live in quiet and imagine a community owning 500 acres of remote rural land.)<br/>2. To what extent will these flow through or be held by the community, to what extent by individual community members, and to what extent by others?<br/>In questions 3 and 4 (below) please consider at least food, shelter, clothing, medical care, communication, education, recreation, transportation, and family relations.<br/>3. What goods and services for community benefit will you provide: a) within, and b) without the community? (e.g. - A nurse living in a rural community which operates an organic farm might provide primary care within the community one day per week free of charge, and outside the community one day per week for fees which she gives to the community, and two days per week to increase her savings.)<br/>4. What goods and services will you draw from: a) within, and b) without the community? (e.g. - A member might want 80% of the her/his food to be grown within the community, and might want to vacation in India each year.)</p>
<h2><a name=""organization""></a>Organization</h2>
<p>1. What domain of your life do you intend to place within the purview of community advice and consent (e.g. occupational choice, living place, child-rearing)?<br/>2. How do you imagine decisions being made with respect to those parts of life subjected to community advice and consent?<br/>3. To what standards shall community members be held?<br/>4. How do you propose members will enter and leave the community
(e.g. - trial membership, asset transfers, etc.)?<br/>5. How do you imagine the other participants (e.g. - number, training, age, world view)?<br/>6. Describe a typical day in your life once your community is formed, noting both the activities which are within and those which are without the purview of the community.</p>

<p>For several years, participants in Magic's Liveable City Project have been evaluating costs and benefits of portable debris blowers used in landscape maintenance, considering what, if any, changes in their use might further common interests, and exploring how such changes might be accomplished. We have found:</p>
<ol>
<li>costs of blowing are extensive;</li>
<li>total costs far outweigh benefits;</li>
<li>while blower operators and their clients pay substantial costs (many hidden) the general public pays heavily and accrues little, if any, benefit;</li>
<li>blower manufacturers and sellers have lavishly funded divisive campaigns of misinformation to secure their profits at the expense of blower operators, their clients, and the general public.</li>
</ol>
<p>In light of these findings, we are seeking a complete ban on debris blowers. We welcome you comments, questions, and support.</p>
<h2><a name=""language""></a>A Few Words About Language</h2>
<p>The commonly used term ""leafblower"" is a misnomer. The most important consequences of using devices marketed under this description are a far cry from moving leaves. They include:</p>
<ol>
<li>generating loud, penetrating noise;</li>
<li>lifting dust and debris (frequently hazardous, toxic, or chemically reactive), pollen, fungal spores, and microbes into the air and deposit them on people, pets, and property;</li>
<li>causing a share of the environmental damage related to their power source; and</li>
<li>perhaps most importantly, unfairly allocating costs and benefits among those who use or are affected by them.</li>
</ol>
<p>Because ""noisy, dangerous, unhealthy, environmentally degrading devices for perpetrating unfair allocation of costs and benefits"" is unwieldy, we refer to them simply as debris blowers. With this term we more accurately captures their function, without sacrificing succintness.</p>
<h2><a name=""types""></a>Types of Debris Blowers</h2>
<p>Currently available debris blowers are powered either by gasoline-fueled engines, or by electric motors. Both types are available in a range of sizes and power ratings. Electric debris blowers are generally smaller, less powerful, and quieter than gasoline models. Most electrics trail a cord, which remains connected to the electrical transmission grid or to a mobile generator, and which limits their range. Battery-powered blowers may become more common because regulation of noise and emissions favors this design, and battery energy-to-weight ratios are improving.</p>
<h2><a name=""noise""></a>Noise</h2>
<p>The most common complaint about blowers is that they are noisy. With typical operating speeds in the range of 5-10,000 rpm — about three times as fast as the engine in your car — blowers emit a penetrating, high-pitched scream. Most blowers have only primitive noise abatement features. The air-cooled engines of gasoline-powered models are by design directly exposed to the environment. Noise levels from gasoline-powered blowers at full throttle have been measured at more than 100 decibels. Within distances of a few meters, many blowers are loud enough to cause temporary hearing loss after only brief exposure, and permanent hearing damage after prolonged exposure, putting operators at special risk. At distances up to several hundred feet, many people find blower noise intrusive, and report that conversation, thinking, sleeping, and other common and essential activities are disturbed.</p>
<h2><a name=""debris""></a>Blown Debris</h2>
<p>A second, and increasingly common complaint about blowers is that airstream from their nozzles, which can move at speeds in excess of a hundred miles per hour, drives litter onto adjoining properties and public rights-of-way, or against plants and structures; lifts previously settled particulate back into the atmosphere, where it is carried onto other people and property; and erodes and degrades soils.</p>
<p>Many people have witnessed blower operators moving debris from one property to another or into streets and other public spaces.</p>
<p>Blower-driven particulates, aerosols, and vapors include toxic or hazardous: volatile organic compounds (e.g. petroleum distillates dripped onto pavement, lawn chemicals); heavy metals (e.g. lead paint dust, copper from brake linings); pesticide-laden plant fragments; pollen; dried rodent, bird, and pet feces; and assorted other waste. After being lofted by debris blowers, these are subsequently deposited onto homes, indoor and outdoor furnishings, soil, food crops, cars, laundry, pets, and people. Their effects range from merely inconvenient to life-threatening. Walkers, cyclists, children, and people with respiratory ailments are all at special risk. Blown debris can temporarily blind a cyclist, precipitate an asthma attack, or permanently lodge in the lungs or — absorbed into and carried by the blood — the brain of a child, posing a lifelong impediment to health.</p>
<p>City of Palo Alto ordinances require suppression of dust on construction sites. City street cleaners sweep and spray rather than blow. Federal and state laws and regulations increasingly prohibit discharge of toxic and hazardous substances that debris blowers routinely disperse.</p>
<p>In addition, debris blowers' high-velocity airstream removes topsoil, mulch, and other organic material from the landscape; dries, hardens, and crusts soil left in place; and dessicates plant roots. The effects of these changes include diminshed plant vigor and growth, less efficient irrigation, reduced humus in soil, and depleted or altogether extinguished populations of soil-dwelling organisms vital to ecosystem balance.</p>
<p>Carelessly used, blowers accumulate and compact debris against plants, fences, buildings, and other structures, and create conditions which promote deterioration.</p>
<h2><a name=""degradation""></a>Environmental Degradation from Power Sources</h2>
<p>A third adverse impact of debris blowers is the environmental degradation resulting from their power sources. While some might view this as an essential price, we think it wise to examine it carefully so that we may better weigh it against the benefits we achieve by operating blowers.</p>
<p>The two-stroke engines of gasoline-powered blowers are notorious for the rate at which they generate exhaust pollutants. These include both combustion products, as well as vaporized, unburned fuel used to cool the engine. An hour of debris blower operation generates as much pollution as driving a car a hundred miles. Spillage and evaporation exacerbate these impacts.</p>
<p>Gas-powered blowers also are partially responsible for environmental damage caused by drilling for, pumping, piping, shipping, refining, and distributing the petroleum products on which they rely.</p>
<p>Electric blowers share similarly the responsibility for impacts of generating electricity. For nuclear power plants, these include long-lived radioactive wastes, unintentional releases of radioactivity, and thermal pollution from cooling water. For wind power plants, they include diminution of raptor populations and despoilation of scenic landscapes. For hydro plants, they include damming wild rivers, depleting fisheries, altering patterns of riparian vegetation, and degrading wetlands. For fossil fuel plants, they include air pollution, contamination of land and water by mining, drilling, and transportation, and global climate disruption.</p>
<h2><a name=""unfairness""></a>Unfairness</h2>
<p>A fourth, and critically important effect of blowers is to undermine the fabric of civil society by allowing some to benefit at the expense of others. A fundamental principle in our political and economic systems is that someone who reaps a gain from an activity is expected to pay its costs.</p>
<p>Benefits of blower operation accrue in some combination of: (1) higher income to blower manufacturers, distributors, and repairpeople, landscape maintenance contractors, and their employees; (2) lower expense and greater tidiness for property owners; and (3) reduced labor for those actually removing debris.</p>
<p>In fact, benefits in Palo Alto appear to be concentrated with manufacturers and distributors.</p>
<p>Property owners and operators may actually suffer qualitative and quantitative losses to soils, plant materials, structures, furnishings, personal well-being, employee productivity, and customer satisfaction which more than offset any economies realized through blower use. An obvious example of this kind of loss is a firm where one, ten, even a hundred $100 per hour programmers stop thinking for 15 minutes once a week while a $60 per month ""mow, blow, and go"" service makes a racket. Is it a $160 per month service? $1060 per month? $10,060?</p>
<p>Blowers bring little gain to landscape contractors, since: (1) virtually all use them, denying any competitive advantage, and (2) the total market in Palo Alto is relatively price-inelastic — a few dollars extra per month are readily affordable, and regular clean-up of most sites where blowers are used is essential.</p>
<p>Landscape maintenance workers have suffered most from blowers, which have entailed a worsening of working conditions without increase in wages, and a displacement of labor costs by capital expenditures in a segment of the economy where unemployment is high and wages low. Blower operators endure prolonged exposures to noise, vibration, air pollution, and repetitive motion among the worst in our modern economy. Though at risk for serious illness and injury, they rarely use proper ear, eye, respiratory tract, or musculoskeletal protection. Operating blowers, they lack opportunity to develop more highly valued skills. Sometimes concerned about immigration status, often easily replaced by those desperate for work, they have little power to improve their lot.</p>
<p>Also shouldering substantial costs and left without any benefits are: (1) dozens, hundreds, sometimes thousands of people who are interrupted in work or relaxation when a blower is used; (2) those on whose property or persons blown matter settles; (3) those whose lives are shortened or whose illnesses are aggravated by breathing blown debris; and (4) everyone who suffers in some way as a result of environmental degradation inherent to manufacturing, maintaining, and powering blowers.</p>
<p>This distribution of costs to some and benefits to others is particularly intolerable because those who shoulder so many costs do so involuntarily.</p>
<h2><a name=""costs""></a>Overall Costs and Benefits</h2>
<p>If we fully price impacts of blowers, paying all who are negatively affected by them a ""fair market value"" for costs they bear, will those who benefit from blowers consider them worthwhile? Let's see what happens when we compensate only for noise.</p>
<p>In opposing a recently-enacted ban in Los Altos, blower advocates claimed that blowing takes one-fifth as long as raking, sweeping, and hand-collecting. Assume a typical weekly blower operating time for a site is six minutes. This ""saves"" twenty-four minutes. If ""only"" four nearby people are sufficiently disturbed to be unable to continue with their chosen activities while the blower is operating, that savings disappears! If forty people suffer a ten percent loss of productivity or pleasure while the blower operates, or if four hundred people suffer a one percent loss, the savings disappears! What does a ten percent loss over six minutes look like? It might be thirty-six seconds of total distraction, or just an annoying awareness occupying ten percent of attention for the entire period. Similarly, a one percent loss might be less that four seconds of total distraction, or a one percent loss of concentration for the entire six minutes.</p>
<p>Let's consider the matter in terms of money. Average annual household income in Palo Alto is about $100k. Assume conservatively that two people work full-time. Each then earns about $25/hour, whether being paid directly in wages or working outside the money economy and sharing income with a partner. Blower operators often earn $5-7 per hour. The twenty-four minute ""savings"" of six minutes of blowing over thirty of raking and sweeping represents $2-3 in wages. Yet six minutes of an average Palo Altan's life is valued at $2.50. The picture here is even bleaker than the one where we looked just at hours of life and valued everyone equally.</p>
<p>Based on noise alone, blowers are a bad deal. If we add other externalized costs, blowers appear as vast, gaping abysses into which the wealth of a community is sucked.</p>
<h2><a name=""values""></a>Values</h2>
<p>Finally, there's a question about why we want to pick up every leaf, every speck of dust, every week. How did we come to believe that this was what we wanted, or a means to get something else that we want? We offer a few thoughts on this topic without pretending that they are a complete ""answer."" For several hundred years at least, Western Europeans and their cultural heirs (we) have pursued a strategy of ""progress"" based upon exploitation of each other (give only what is required; take as much as you can get) and conversion of nature to artifact. Many of us, pointing to the rise to dominance of people who practice this approach, imagine more of the same to be a prescription for a happy future. Our eyes fixed on the prize of ""tidiness"" by which we symbolize our putative ""control"" of nature, we miss the many signs that ours is an increasingly disordered biosphere, becoming less hospitable to human life. Of critical importance are overall loss of predictability and control, and undermining of individual and common purpose which accompany our continuing depradations of each other and the rest of nature. Like passengers on the Titanic, we are delighted with details and proudly confident of our safety, even as we remain ignorant of our vulnerability and imminent loss.</p>
<h2><a name=""remedies""></a>Remedies</h2>
<p>If you agree that debris blowers are a bad deal, you may wonder what to do about them. In an ideal society, people might be committed to health, cooperation, and environmental stewardship, and informed about the principles of ecology. Under such circumstances, those who own blowers will voluntarily retire them, and those who manufacture and sell them will cease.</p>
<p>In the current social context, some people have asked those who maintain their properties to work without blowers or to use them minimally, while others have declined to ask any change; some landscape contractors faced with blower bans have cooperated in guiding their personnel in operating them in ways that reduce imposition on the general public, while others have carried on with business as usual. Concerned horticultural experts have made inroads explaining to clients, contractors, and workers alike the risks of blowers for plants, soils, and structures, but in a market where competition is largely based on price rather than quality, blower abuse remains common. Various legislative restrictions on times, locations, volumes, and types of blower have been enacted, but all but complete bans have proven difficult or impossible to enforce.</p>
<p>Blower manufacturers and distributors have poured money and falsehoods into influencing state and local politics to favor their interests. Tactics employed have included unscrupulous manipulation of less affluent, often non-English speaking laborers by subjecting them to unsupported threats about lost livelihood and claims of racist discrimination. Blower advocates have organized landscape workers into a ""gardeners"" association, even as they have promoted a kind of landscape maintenance that is the antithesis of gardening, and condemned these people to dead-end jobs. Echo (brand) equipment is promoted with claims about its quiet that are deemed false by Consumers Union, one of the most highly respected consumer testing services in the nation.</p>
<p>Alternatives to blowers exist, and are used by most people in most places with satisfactory result. We can alter our standards of tidiness, redesign our landscapes, adapt our lives to the absence of blowers, and be better for it. The people of dozens of California communities, including nearby Los Altos, have banned gasoline powered blowers with good results. In some locales (e.g. Hermosa Beach) all debris blowers are banned. Reports from these places indicate that costs of landscape maintenance for public and private properties have remained steady, standards of tidiness acceptable to individual property owners and the general public have been successfully maintained, and laborers' jobs have been preserved and their working conditions enhanced. Palo Alto once led in such matters. It's time for us to lead again.</p>
<h2><a name=""purpose""></a>Purpose of Law</h2>
<p>Some may argue that landscape maintenance contractors or employees will suffer as a result of a ban. We have already discussed why losses to blower owners are likely to be limited to the depreciated value of their blowers, and why, in fact, blower operators are actually likely to fare better after a ban. Blower manufacturers and distributors may well earn fewer profits, but they have chosen to manufacture and sell equipment with horrendous externalized costs — with all the entrepreneurial risk this entails — and they have had amply notice that public disapproval was resulting in increasing regulation, including numerous bans.</p>
<p>Others may say that the cost of municipal services will rise or their quality decline. The appropriate response to this is to reconsider what standards are important to us as a community — including what we are now foregoing — and then find a fair way to finance services that meet them. Exacting a price in morbidity, mortality, and other factors of diminished life quality from large numbers who have indicated unwillingness to pay for the benefit of a few is bad government.</p>
<p>The purpose of law is to provide a framework within which people can act to further our own interests without adversely affecting others. A ban on blowers will achieve this. Rather than ""leveling the playing field"" by tolerating ever more public and worker abuse in the name of individual freedom for manufacturers and distributors, let's increase freedom for many by raising standards of health, cooperation, and environmental stewardship in our society.</p>
<h2><a name=""context""></a>Larger Context</h2>
<p>Though careful lest we make too big a deal of what may be only a trifle in the eyes of many, we submit that banning blowers is one of countless small steps that we will necessarily take if we are to make our community a place where people feel greater peace within, with each other, and with nature. Please join us in working towards this end.</p>

<h2><a name=""summary""></a>Summary</h2>
<p>Holistic Resource Management is based upon restoration and emulation of natural ecosystem relationships. It is a complex theory and practice requiring extraordinary attention and dedication from land managers. Careful regulation of livestock is one of its defining qualities.</p>
<h4>Fire Hazard Reduction</h4>
<p>Accumulated biomass from brushy plants and wood detritus, particularly that which lies within woodlands, under mature trees, or adjacent to vulnerable structures, is the fuel which contributes most to fire hazard on the Academic Reserve. Grazing does little to reduce this fuel, and improper grazing may increase it. Bay Area oak habitat managers prefer to remove it by burning, which also may yield substantial ecosystem restoration benefits. Intensive livestock grazing can lessen fire hazards by augmenting firebreaks or creating low-fuel areas around sensitive sites. This use of livestock might meet HRM objectives better than disking, and at substantial savings in disking expense. Mowing can lessen fire hazard from annual plant biomass in a manner less destructive than disking and less difficult to manage than grazing.</p>
<h4>HRM Grazing Regimes</h4>
<p>HRM guidelines for grazing rely upon high stock densities rotated through paddocks (fenced areas) to ensure thorough cropping of edible forage, followed by livestock exclusion for periods long enough to permit plants to recover the energy lost to grazing. Increasing the number of paddocks results in each paddock's being more evenly and fully grazed; it improves the ratio of recovery period to grazing period; and it enhances the likelihood that repetitive grazing with adequate intervening recovery will be possible. In all these ways, augmenting the number of paddocks lessens the risk of overgrazing, and increases utilization of range productivity. Temporary fences and full-time herd supervision are commonly necessary. Grazing by diverse livestock (e.g. - goats used in conjunction with cttle for brush control), though challenging to manage, can generate more beneficial impacts than single-species grazing. Horse owners are potential contributors to an HRM program on the Academic Reserve.</p>
<h4>Oak Protection</h4>
<p>More than two thousand young oaks widely scattered across the Academic Reserve are vulnerable to grazing cattle and other predators. In the absence of measures to protect these, much of the university's investment in oak regeneration may be lost. Area exclusion of livestock and protection of individual trees are methods already proven on the reserve. The estimated cost of materials to defend individual trees from cattle and rodents is five to ten dollars per tree, though if livestock prove determined to disturb protective devices, material costs might be twice this. Regulating grazing by cattle or other livestock so that unprotected seedling oaks can grow to maturity may be possible, but entails substantial risk of failure with considerable ensuing loss.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Lacking confidential information about university priorities and about the costs and benefits of various possible courses of action to affected parties, we are without basis to make firm recommendations. We will be pleased to participate in the development of an HRM program aimed at enhancing ecosystem integrity and productivity on the Academic Reserve.</p>
<h2><a name=""hrm""></a>Holistic Resource Management<sup><a href=""#1"">1</a></sup></h2>
<p>Holistic Resource Management is a process directed at meeting objectives in three realms:</p>
<ol>
<li>human life-quality,</li>
<li>ecosystem yields, and</li>
<li>natural resource conservation.</li>
</ol>
<p>An underlying premise of HRM is that maintenance of ecosystem integrity preserves the value of land, by protecting its capacity to generate a sustainable stream of ecosystem benefits. Stanford's land endowment is unique. A conscientiously developed HRM program for the Academic Reserve lands can be a way to conserve and increase their value.</p>
<p>An HRM program can be designed to address Stanford planners' concerns about wildfire, livestock, and oaks within the context of more general goals, like protecting and enhancing the quality of soil, water, and air, maintaining diversity and dynamic stability in living populations, and increasing the amount of energy stored in the ecosystem and the rate at which energy is captured by it. An HRM approach also will likely rely upon a broad range of tools and techniques, which may include permanent and temporary fencing and stock watering facilities, wildlife attractors and habitat enhancers, prescribed fire, rangeland rest, disking, mowing, seeding and planting, intensive grazing by different livestock species, active herding and moving of animals, and user education. Perhaps most importantly, an HRM plan will entail frequent monitoring and adjustment. Allan Savory, the founder of HRM, emphasizes that a good practitioner always assumes that the management strategy currently being implemented is wrong.</p>
<p>Lying at the edge of the San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose metropolis, the Academic Reserve is more heavily impacted by external factors than are most of the places where HRM has been practiced. Hydrology, air quality, and surrounding land use, as well as a plethora of local, state, and federal regulations are largely beyond the control of university personnel. Here, where unanticipated outside influences can be common, and interventions by land managers are constrained in so many ways, the pattern of frequent, small-scale trial, assessment, and adjustment characteristic of HRM will necessarily be even more intensive than on a more typical site.<sup><a href=""#2"">2</a></sup></p>
<h4>HRM Grazing</h4>
<p>Stanford land managers contemplate cattle grazing as one component of an HRM strategy. In grazing compatible with HRM principles, livestock are tightly controlled. Savory developed HRM after years of observing the role of wild African ungulate herds in the ecology of grasslands. His livestock management methods emphasize regulation of the timing of an animal's bite on forage plants. By simulating some of the conditions which existed in grassland ecosystems prior to the domestication of grazing animals, Savory aims to restore patterns of interaction closer to those which were present during the millions of years over which grasses and their herbivore predators coevolved.</p>
<h4>Preventing Overgrazing</h4>
<p>In explaining how HRM works, Savory describes the process of overgrazing in minute detail. Animals graze certain plants, often leaving other nearby plants untouched. The bitten plants are stimulated to put on new growth, which offers more protein and energy, and less fiber, than older growth. Animals in the area graze the new growth preferentially. When livestock have prolonged access to an area, certain plants are overgrazed while their neighbors rest.</p>
<p>Herds of animals grazing continuously on relatively large plots usually both overgraze and overrest plants in the same area. This outcome may manifest as a mosaic of fairly extensive ungrazed and overgrazed patches, or it may take a more subtle form, dispersed among a variety of plants and species in a pattern difficult to discern with casual observation. HRM practitioners aim to prevent this result by concentrating stock in relatively small areas for brief periods. In these circumstances, animals graze all edible plants. They are then removed, and plants are permitted to grow undisturbed until they can be safely grazed again. This careful regulation of livestock is a defining quality of HRM, and is essential for HRM to fulfill its promise.<sup><a href=""#3"">3</a></sup></p>
<h4>Resources for HRM</h4>
<p>If Stanford personnel decide to proceed with the development of an HRM program, its various components might qualify for financial subsidy or other assistance from state and federal agencies. The Agriculture Stabilization and Conservation Service offers grants of up to $3,000 per year for projects with resource enhancement objectives. California Division of Forestry makes $10,000 cost-sharing grants for qualifying land management projects, and through its Vegetation Management Program, and Forest Stewardship programs provides other types of technical support for grazing, burning, and other activities aimed at enhancement of wildlife and native plant habitat, or stimulation of forest and rangeland productivity.<sup><a href=""#4"">4</a></sup></p>
<h2><a name=""fire""></a>Fire Hazard Reduction</h2>
<p>Wildfire in the foothills section of the Academic Reserve poses risk both to natural features, like native oaks, and to artificial features like research facilities and nearby homes. High values of fire-vulnerable elements in and near the reserve, and concerns of residents, researchers, and recreational users are reasons to be thorough in fire hazard reduction.</p>
<h4>Characteristics of Grassfires</h4>
<p>The grasses and low-growing annuals which populate much of the Academic Reserve are a dispersed fuel. Fire professionals term them ""cool-burning"" because they release much less heat per unit of land than forest or scrub.<sup><a href=""#5"">5</a></sup> Grassfires are quick to spread, yet much less likely to ""jump"" firebreaks than fires in forest or chaparral.<sup><a href=""#6"">6</a></sup> In oak woodlands they very rarely become canopy fires in the absence of substantial additional fuel, like brushy understory species or accumulated woody debris.<sup><a href=""#7"">7</a></sup></p>
<h4>Risk vs. Hazard</h4>
<p>CDF personnel and other professionals with fire management expertise emphasize the distinction between fire risk and fire hazard.<sup><a href=""#8"">8</a></sup> Risk is the chance a fire will occur, hazard is the magnitude of damage likely to result. The former can be of little consequence where the latter is small.</p>
<p>Areas like the Academic Reserve can be managed so that fire hazard is close to zero.<sup><a href=""#9"">9</a></sup> The strategies for doing so are: eliminate concentrations of combustible material; provide firebreaks; maintain adequate fire-suppression response capability; and educate and regulate users.</p>
<h4>Hazardous Fuels</h4>
<p>In the foothills region, chaparral and other brushy understory plants, and woody debris are materials likely to fuel damaging fires.<sup><a href=""#10"">10</a></sup> These are more dangerous when situated within or adjacent to woodland areas, or when they border buildings or trees near buildings. Regular removal of brush and woody debris from sensitive areas is key to fuel reduction in the foothills.<sup><a href=""#11"">11</a></sup></p>
<h4>Grazing and Fire</h4>
<p>Grazing cattle can lessen the quantity of fuel which accumulates as a result of a single season's growth by the species they eat. Their suppression of the many annuals and perennials which they reject as food, and their impacts upon dead branches, snags and other woody debris-all of which are potentially troublesome fuels-are mostly limited to trampling.<sup><a href=""#12"">12</a>, <a href=""#13"">13</a></sup></p>
<p>Inadequately managed cattle can actually increase fire hazard by contributing to the spread of exotic annuals like thistle and mustard, which they refuse to eat.<sup><a href=""#14"">14</a></sup> These opportunistic species readily colonize disturbed soils and places where other plants have been overgrazed. On the Academic Reserve they now grow in dense stands where cattle have historically congregated. This is especially true under canopies of large oaks and around previous watering sites. As noted above, accumulation of biomass from such plants within the driplines of mature trees poses fire hazards which experts consider more substantial than those presented by ungrazed grasslands.</p>
<p>Theoretically, cattle can be managed to diminish populations of thistle and other unwanted exotics, but we have yet to find specific examples of significant success in this endeavor. Some ranchers using HRM grazing regimes report that stands of bunchgrasses, primarily Stipa pulchra, are more vigorous and widespread as a result, but those we interviewed stopped short of asserting that weedy exotics have been substantially reduced in number or vigor.<sup><a href=""#15"">15</a></sup></p>
<p>Grazing generates cash income for the university, and the presence of grazing lessee personnel may enhance public safety; however, only carefully regulated grazing to augment firebreaks or create low-fuel zones adjacent to sensitive facilities can contribute much to reducing risk of loss from fire. In some locations such grazing might meet HRM objectives better than disking.</p>
<h4>Prescribed Fire</h4>
<p>Fire is a natural part of California's oak woodland ecosystem, and people have used fire as a management tool since pre-history. Native Americans regularly set fires, and European settlers continued this practice. Until the 1950's controlled burning remained an accepted means of improving grazing lands and destroying unwanted understory plants and detritus.<sup><a href=""#16"">16</a></sup> During the next several decades fire suppression became increasingly common, especially near urban settlements. As a result, fuel accumulated and the risk of catastrophic wildfires increased.<sup><a href=""#17"">17</a></sup> In addition, long-standing ecological relationships were disrupted.<sup><a href=""#18"">18</a></sup></p>
<p>In recent years, fire has again become more widely accepted as a restoration tool. The capacity of fire to induce resurgence of native plant populations in degraded ecosystems is well-documented. In California managers of many Nature Conservancy preserves, state parks, and national parks, and a growing number of private landowners now employ prescribed burning in oak biomes to restore native species diversity and with it, ecological stability.<sup><a href=""#19"">19</a></sup></p>
<p>Like wildfires, controlled burns leave a blackened landscape, which most people find ugly. Note, however, that fire professionals consider early summer the time when prescribed burns are relatively safe and most beneficial in terms of fire risk reduction.<sup><a href=""#20"">20</a></sup> This coincides with a lull in the university calendar, and thus reduces negative impact on the Stanford community. Also, a program of rotational burning will in any single year entail much less extensive scarring than that which results from a major wildfire.</p>
<p>Local regulations allow burning on private lands between November 1 and April 30 as a method of forest management. Burning during other times of the year can be permitted for the purpose of wildland vegetation management. Burn plans require approval by Bay Area Air Quality Management District
(BAAQMD) personnel and a fire permit issued by the local fire authority. Following approval, burning may take place on days designated by Bay Area Air Quality Management District regulators. Bay Area air quality standards are strict and there are a limited number of days each year when weather and air quality conditions make a prescribed burn acceptable. Costs of burning are borne by the landowner, and include fees charged by fire safety personnel, plus any damage to people or property resulting from a burn.<sup><a href=""#21"">21</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite these constraints Bay Area land managers have been employing prescribed burns for the past decade to reduce unwanted biomass accumulation and to further restoration activities. BAAQMD personnel work closely with landowners to ensure that approved burns can take place, and people experienced in fire management at Annadell State Park, the BAAQMD, and U.C. Berkeley's Integrated Hardwood Range Management Program have all offered their expertise to assist in designing and implementing a program of prescribed burning for the Academic Reserve. Burn regulations are currently in flux, and proposed amendments appear likely to make fire an even more readily accessible tool.<sup><a href=""#22"">22</a></sup></p>
<h4>Firebreaks</h4>
<p>The placement of firebreaks and their specifications are largely beyond the scope of this report. Roads within the Academic Reserve provide some protection. Minimum requirements are established by law. Methods of fulfilling legal obligations or implementing additional measures to secure valuable natural or artificial assets can be assessed on the basis of their contribution to HRM objectives and their cost.</p>
<h4>Disking</h4>
<p>In many oak savannas and oak woodlands, disked firebreaks are considered sufficient manipulation of the landscape to reduce fire risks to acceptable levels.<sup><a href=""#23"">23</a></sup> The current system of roads and disked firebreaks on the Academic Reserve meet the university's responsibilities as defined by local and state law.</p>
<p>Stanford planners are particularly sensitive to the concerns of owners and occupants of buildings and other improvements in and around the foothills portion of the Academic Reserve, and consider the value of these assets and the peace of mind of university community members to warrant extraordinary measures. Additional disking immediately adjacent to high-value homes and other facilities has been used to provide an extra margin of safety and peace-of-mind.</p>
<p>Disking, like fire, leaves the land scarred, and some university homeowners and Academic Reserve recreational users consider it a nuisance. In addition, disking accelerates erosion, kills beneficial fauna like snakes and lizards, obstructs the establishment of perennials, including oaks, provides the kind of disturbance which favors the spread of noxious species like thistle, and entails substantial expense. Because of its many drawbacks, especially its adverse affects on ecosystem integrity, disking is used with restraint in HRM programs.<sup><a href=""#24"">24</a></sup></p>
<h4>Mowing</h4>
<p>Mowing can prevent fuel accumulation with much less ecosystem disruption than disking.<sup><a href=""#25"">25</a></sup> Mowing substantially diminishes fire risk even where trimmings are allowed to remain on the land, because it reduces the surface-to-volume ratio of the fuel. Cut grasses lying on the ground burn far more slowly than standing dry grass. When mowing is accompanied by removal of plant material, fire risk is lowered further, but care must be taken to preserve organic and mineral content of soils, and to provide adequate seed where annual plants are desired. In Contra Costa County, fire authorities consider a three-inch mowing of a fifteen foot-wide strip an acceptable fuel break on open space lands.<sup><a href=""#26"">26</a></sup> If mowing is substituted for disking, and properly timed, it can be a means to encourage the displacement of exotic grasses and other annuals by native perennial bunchgrasses.<sup><a href=""#27"">27</a></sup></p>
<p>Whether mowing is in place of disking or a supplement to it, marking oak seedlings in areas to be mowed with semi-permanent stakes so that mower operators can easily avoid them will reduce the risk that mowing will be an impediment to seedling recruitment. Mowing may even enhance survival and vigor of young oaks by lessening competition for moisture and by reducing shade from surrounding plants.<sup><a href=""#28"">28</a></sup></p>
<p>Regularly mowing the open areas around the private residences along Junipero Serra Boulevard can reduce the potential of fire damage to these residences and provide reassurance to their occupants. The contractor currently responsible for disking firebreaks on the Academic Reserve has noted that mowing a 250-foot wide swath starting at the fence near Junipero Serra Boulevard, following the fenceline behind the houses adjacent to the Academic Reserve, crossing the extension of Frenchman's Road which enters the foothills, and following the fenceline around to Junipero Serra Boulevard will entail only modest additional cost.</p>
<h4>Fire Suppression</h4>
<p>Availability of fire-suppression personnel and equipment are generally beyond the scope of this report. Installation of emergency call boxes similar to those increasingly common along public highways might enable quicker response by trained fire-suppression personnel and otherwise contribute to the safety of people and property on and near the Academic Reserve.</p>
<h4>User Education and Regulation</h4>
<p>Currently open fires, including smoking, are prohibited in the foothills. Voluntary compliance and enforcement by a ranger working for the university and by users themselves have resulted in near universal adherence to this regulation.</p>
<h2><a name=""grazing""></a>Holistic Resource Management – Grazing Regimes<sup><a href=""#29"">29</a></sup></h2>
<p>Grazing livestock on the Academic Reserve entails costs and benefits. Which of these predominates depends upon the value of lease income, and of the positive and negative impacts of grazing upon the land. Because the cumulative effects of decades of grazing are impossible to isolate and precisely quantify, the calculation of net costs or benefits to date is at best a difficult undertaking. Cost-benefit analysis of contemplated future action is even more problematic. Historic grazing practices may be very poor basis for evaluating the impacts of grazing regulated by HRM principles. Ongoing disruptions of the larger environment in which the Academic Reserve exists make extrapolation of many aspects of past experience unsound.</p>
<p>Though cattle grazing has been implicated in the degradation of oak woodlands throughout California, recent research by HRM practitioners has shown that carefully controlled livestock can arrest and even reverse certain types of ecological degradation.<sup><a href=""#30"">30</a></sup> Properly managed animals may provide valuable agitation to oak woodlands.<sup><a href=""#31"">31</a></sup> By removing decaying material and old growth from perennials, livestock can stimulate regrowth, contribute to the development of stronger and more stable root systems, and improve water and mineral cycles. HRM proponents assert that a properly grazed ecosystem can become a sustainable oak savannah or woodland community. At the same time, both they and virtually all other qualified observers concur that a mismanaged grazing regime can push these often fragile habitats towards desertification.<sup><a href=""#32"">32</a></sup></p>
<p>Cattle and other herbivores graze selectively.<sup><a href=""#33"">33</a></sup> Overgrazing may be viewed as a result of inadequate recovery between grazings. Plants unable to replenish their energy stocks eventually die. Overgrazing can transform a diverse, stable plant community into a less complex and more brittle one by subtle extirpation of more vulnerable species. On lands like Stanford's Academic Reserve, overgrazing may be occurring even if a lush cover of annual plants returns each year.</p>
<p>HRM generally prescribes the establishment of several paddocks roughly equal in size, or more importantly, in livestock carrying capacity. Overgrazing occurs when animals linger too long on a site or return too quickly to it. Adequate recovery periods, proper sizing of paddocks, and appropriate stock density are essential to prevent overgrazing.</p>
<h4>Grazing Schedules</h4>
<p>The recovery period for a given paddock is the time necessary for plants within it to replenish the energy lost by being grazed. Recovery periods depend upon weather, intensity of grazing, species mix, soil quality, presence of predators and pathogens, and a host of other factors. They can vary widely year-to-year and site-to-site. Over time they can become much longer or shorter.<sup><a href=""#34"">34</a></sup></p>
<p>Once the recovery period has been estimated, grazing periods for each paddock can be calculated by the formula: grazing period = recovery period/(number of paddocks - 1). This formula presumes that paddocks are of roughly equal productivity. For example, a ninety-day recovery period for an area with six equal paddocks yields an eighteen day average grazing period. In general, slow plant growth requires slower moves among paddocks, and rapid growth calls for more rapid moves.</p>
<p>A livestock manager may want to move animals sooner than the end of the calculated period because the grass appears overgrazed, the stock need to be supplemented, or for other reasons; however, cutting the grazing period for one paddock reduces the recovery period for all others.</p>
<h4>Paddock Size and Number</h4>
<p>As more paddocks are available to a manager, the ratio of recovery period to grazing period rises. Increasing the number of paddocks also results in each paddock's being more evenly and fully grazed, because grazing impacts can be concentrated, and repetitive grazing with adequate intervening recovery is more likely to be possible. This lessens the risk of overgrazing, and increases utilization of range productivity.</p>
<p>For example, where the total grazing season is 180 days, and the recovery period is ninety days, a four paddock arrangement will allow each of two paddocks to be given a single thirty-day period of grazing, and each of two others to be given two thirty-day periods with ninety days of recovery between grazings. With the same grazing and recovery periods, a sixteen-paddock arrangement will permit every paddock to be grazed twice for six days. Though such calculations are first-order approximations, and adjustments to reflect rates of forage growth and other variables are ongoing, they illustrate clearly the advantage of increasing the number of paddocks.</p>
<p>Ranchers and other land managers commonly use electric fencing or other temporary restraints to restrict livestock to smaller paddocks within larger, permanently fenced areas. Electric fencing can be moved easily, and in many stock operations has proven economically sound. The flexibility with which electric fencing can be rearranged is well-suited to the HRM practice of accommodating seasonal and year-to-year changes in range productivity with altered grazing regimes. Though the lessee reported numerous difficulties arising from initial trials of electric fencing on the Academic Reserve for a few weeks during the 1993-94 grazing season, different deployment and monitoring arrangements might yet yield satisfactory results.</p>
<h4>Stock Density</h4>
<p>Stock density is the number of animals per unit of land. Though stock density might at first seem the factor most likely to be correlated with overgrazing, Savory and others have substantiated the claim that excessively long stays in a paddock, and insufficient paddock rest between grazings are often more critical.</p>
<p>HRM practitioners have noted a number of advantages to dense stocking. Animals graze a greater proportion of available plants and graze them more evenly, leaving fewer ungrazed or severely grazed. Distributions of dung and urine are more uniform. Animals move with greater frequency, stimulating them and providing a more constant level of nutrition. Tighter plant communities develop, and forage contains more leaf and less fiber. As a result of these and other factors, animal performance in general improves.<sup><a href=""#35"">35</a></sup> However, these benefits come at some risk. Densely stocked animals pose danger of severe ecosystem damage if they remain too long or return too quickly. Net improvement of rangeland like the Reserve has yet to be shown.</p>
<p>Livestock operators engaged in HRM estimate stocking density on the basis of range carrying capacity. A stocking rate of 1:20 indicates that each animal will be allocated twenty acres of pasture. If the grazing season lasts 180 days, this level of grazing can only be sustained if each twenty acres can supply 180 animal-days of feed. Under this regime, each acre must supply nine animal-days. Thus, one-ninth acre (a square approximately seventy feet by seventy feet) must feed one animal for one day. A successful HRM rancher frequently assesses the condition of land and forage to determine whether these are consistent with existing and planned stock densities. Finding sustainable stocking levels is an on-going process of trial and error. Because of the complexity of multi-herd operations, some HRM consultants suggest that transition to HRM be made while running a single herd.<sup><a href=""#35"">35</a></sup></p>
<h4>Herding</h4>
<p>Prior to the introduction of domesticated livestock, native grazing animals herded together to minimize their vulnerability to predators. They grazed intensively and moved often. Later, dogs and cowboys replaced predators and cattle replaced populations of native species. In modern times, predator extirpation has made herding largely unnecessary for livestock protection.</p>
<p>HRM advocates are accumulating evidence that herding improves the integrity of grazed ecosystems. Unherded animals often find favorite areas within a paddock. This can especially be damaging if the paddock is large, stock densities are low, and grazing is prolonged. Many portions of the Academic Reserve where mustard and thistle are dense today mark areas where cattle previously congregated and overgrazed. Often these will be only a few feet from stands of native perennials which are commonly ungrazed when stock roam large paddocks for long periods. Herding can ensure that animals graze all areas and all edible species within a paddock, and permits them to be used to compact soil or break down capped soils, and to trample down excessively heavy crops, such as mustard and thistle.</p>
<p>Herding can be accomplished by one full-time farmhand on a horse. At night animals can be left to roam or cordoned off with a simple lightweight fence
(such as a piece of wire or cord wrapped around four trees).<sup><a href=""#36"">36</a></sup></p>
<p>HRM consultants have noted that in areas like the Academic Reserve, opportunities for integrating horse owners and their animals into management programs abound. Current local horse boarding rates can be three to four hundred dollars per month. Horse owners may find it advantageous to assist with herding in exchange for boarding, grazing, and access privileges on the Academic Reserve.</p>
<p>Some ranchers have experimented with salt blocks, water, and baled feed to create herding impacts in specific areas. For example, a salt block placed in the center of a dense stand of mustard can cause animals to thoroughly trample the area. In this way, the mustard can be suppressed. However, it is important to move salt blocks at least twice daily to prevent damage from over-trampling. Again, the goal is to simulate natural patterns in which a densely packed herd moves quickly through an area. Achieving this effect is particularly important in areas which have already suffered from overgrazing.</p>
<h4>Water</h4>
<p>On the Academic Reserve, the limited availability of water poses a constraint in paddock sizing and configuration. HRM practitioners commonly design paddocks so that borders radiate outward from a water source, permitting stock to access a single source from a number of paddocks. They also may use temporary watering facilities to herd animals. A variety of equipment for trucking water and providing animals temporary troughs is available, and the installation of permanent watering facilities in additional Academic Reserve locations may be justified.</p>
<h4>Diversity of Animal Grazers</h4>
<p>Introducing different species of grazing animals is a widely recognized method for achieving native plant diversity. The forage preferences, hoof and mouth physiology, and herding habits of animals vary.<sup><a href=""#37"">37</a></sup> An integrated grazing plan that utilizes cattle, horses, sheep, goats, and even deer may foster oak regeneration, and control mustard, thistle, and tarweed populations more effectively than any scheme entailing cattle alone;<sup><a href=""#38"">38</a></sup> however, managing multiple herds on the same land requires sophisticated expertise, and intensive monitoring.</p>
<h4>Community Education</h4>
<p>Reintroduction of cattle as part of an HRM program will require visible changes to the Academic Reserve. Modest community education, like explanatory signs at reserve entrances, and written materials available upon request, may prove invaluable in recruiting community support and cooperation. Such actions seem particularly essential if the incessant stream of changes and adjustments characteristic of HRM are to be met with understanding and acceptance. In addition, community participation in various HRM activities may lower university and lessee costs, and enable program enhancements otherwise impossible.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>The Academic Reserve is a brittle ecosystem, an area where decay is primarily driven by oxidation and weathering, rather than by decomposer organisms. In such ecosystems agitation plays an important role in preserving biological diversity and maintaining ecosystems in dynamic equilibrium. Cattle and other livestock can provide this agitation and can effectively remove certain types of biomass; however, employing grazing animals in the framework of HRM requires that they be managed so that their behavior closely mirrors that of natural grazers.</p>
<p>The combination of brief, intensive grazing and adequate recovery is an essential element of HRM livestock programs. Configuring the Academic Reserve into numerous small paddocks, and stocking them at high densities for short periods will enable university planners and lessees to begin to ascertain whether HRM yields results consistent with their objectives.</p>
<h2><a name=""protecting""></a>Protecting Young Oaks</h2>
<p>Implementation of the Vegetation Management Plan for the Academic Reserve (VMP) began ten years ago. The VMP authors proposed that the northern slopes of the reserve be divided into four paddocks, and that grazing be rotationally excluded from each of these for ten years in order to permit natural regeneration to occur. On southern slopes they proposed establishment of isolated protected sites for direct seeding of oaks.</p>
<p>The original framework of the plan has been repeatedly adjusted to accommodate conditions on the land, results of oak regeneration research at Stanford and elsewhere, and changing university priorities. Today there are at least two thousand young oaks scattered across the reserve. These include naturally seeded trees which escaped predation in areas from which cattle have been excluded, naturally occurring seedling and sapling trees individually protected from cattle in grazed areas, and trees planted under the auspices of the VMP throughout the area.</p>
<p>Under the conditions which have prevailed for the last decade, oaks on most parts of the reserve have grown too slowly to become capable of resisting cattle after only ten years. In many areas livestock have been excluded for less than half that duration. Where planting occurred recently with the expectation that livestock exclusion was to extend at least a decade into the future, young trees are especially vulnerable to depredation by grazing cattle. On the Academic Reserve and elsewhere in California, voles and other rodents have been found to pose a serious threat to juvenile oaks. Unless both naturally and artificially established seedlings and saplings are given continuing protection from livestock and rodents, much of Stanford's investment in oak regeneration may be lost.</p>
<p>Divers protection strategies are available. These include continuing cattle exclusion from large areas, controlling the timing of grazing to enable young oaks to recover after livestock have been removed, installing tree shelters around individual trees, and fencing single trees or groups of trees.</p>
<h4>Cattle Exclusion Areas</h4>
<p>Barring livestock from grazing young oaks is the surest means to prevent them from interfering with regeneration. Wholesale exclusion from the northern slopes of the reserve has enabled many seedling and sapling trees to grow without setbacks from grazing. Escaped animals were common in the early years of livestock exclusion, and repeatedly damaged seedling trees. During the most recent grazing season (1993-94) cattle have less often invaded the exclusion area, and lessee personnel have acted more promptly than in past years to recapture animals and return them to the leasehold.</p>
<p>The rest afforded land by livestock exclusion can encourage evolution of a diverse and stable plant community, and can be especially healing in an area where overgrazing has occurred; however, in ecosystems like those on the Academic Reserve, where a significant amount of decay occurs by oxidation and weathering, the beneficial effects of rest may decrease in value when the duration of rest is excessive and the beneficial agitation which stock can produce is forfeited.</p>
<p>Oak woodlands in California have evolved with agitation from periodic fire, and from cyclical browsing and grazing by diverse herbivores.<sup><a href=""#39"">39</a></sup> Displacing these long-standing phenomena by fire suppression and sustained mono-species grazing has disrupted water and mineral cycles, brought wholesale shifts in types and quantities of biota, and contributed to the decline of oak ecosystems throughout the state.<sup><a href=""#40"">40</a></sup> Also, in the absence of grazing, the risk of grass fire remains higher.</p>
<h4>Strictly Timed Cattle Grazing</h4>
<p>If cattle are removed from an area while moisture levels in the soil are still adequate to support oak seedling growth, grazed oaks may recover well enough to grow-albeit slowly-into mature trees.<sup><a href=""#41"">41</a></sup> Many soils on the Academic Reserve are too dry to support seedling growth after April or May. Whether an HRM program can be designed both to reduce significantly the fire hazard from standing biomass which remains after grazing has ended, and to allow successful recovery by seedling oaks is yet to be proven.</p>
<p>Unprotected oaks that are grazed after water is inadequate to support growth will be unable to recover until the next growing season, when they will again be grazed.<sup><a href=""#42"">42</a></sup> Only seedlings in the most favorable locations are likely to endure this cycle for more than a few years. Those that do will often remain stunted shrubs, unable to establish a central leader because the terminal buds of dominant branches are repeatedly removed by grazers.<sup><a href=""#43"">43</a></sup></p>
<h4>Tree Shelters</h4>
<p>Plastic tree shelters placed around planted trees and other young seedlings have proven in some California locations to be a solid defense against grazing cattle and rodents. In addition, the microclimate within shelters encourages rapid growth and improves tree vigor, so that trees move beyond the reach of grazing animals and can withstand grazing pressure earlier in their lives.</p>
<p>Tree shelters fastened to a heavy T-post have been used experimentally in an area grazed by cattle at the U.C. Berkeley Sierra Field Station. In general, cattle ignored the shelters. Where cattle did rub up against the shelters, they proved resistant to damage. Protection might be improved by keeping the ground around sheltered trees clear of vegetation, to discourage cattle from even approaching them.<sup><a href=""#44"">44</a></sup></p>
<p>Results of the fire of 1992 and experiments conducted by <em>Magic</em> personnel provide bases for assessing the fire hazard posed by shelters. Both types of shelter deployed on the Academic Reserve are flammable; however they burn much like a candle, slowly and at low intensity. Most of their heat is dissipated into the air. Though above-ground growth of enclosed trees may be consumed, root systems will likely be spared severe damage since the burning shelters raise the temperature of the ground very little. Wildfire may destroy the shelters, entailing replacement expense, but in a controlled burn, shelters can be removed beforehand and replaced afterwards without excessive cost.</p>
<p>For effective protection from grazing, four-foot shelters may be sufficient, but five-foot shelters are more secure.<sup><a href=""#45"">45</a></sup> One heavy steel T-post is required for each shelter. Shelters of these sizes cost between two and three dollars each in the quantities required to protect identified vulnerable seedlings. These include about nine hundred planted sites and an equal number of volunteer trees. Posts cost approximately as much as the shelters themselves.</p>
<p>Though a T-post and tree shelter scheme may prove adequate defense against grazing animals and rodents, the behavior of livestock can be difficult to foresee. In situations where livestock repeatedly disturb shelters, or where trees have grown too bushy to be confined to shelters without destructive pruning, fencing may be required.</p>
<h4>Fencing Individual Trees</h4>
<p>In the savanna region, a design utilizing about twelve feet of sturdy building fabric wire and two T-posts has proven adequate to protect individual oaks from cattle. If necessary, this system can be enhanced with a wrap of barbed wire. The cost of materials to protect an individual tree in this way is about ten dollars. One drawback to this design is that it can encourage rodent activity near the base of the tree.<sup><a href=""#46"">46</a></sup> Suppressing vegetation within the enclosure with mulch has reduced rodent intrusion, but entails additional cost.</p>
<h4>Area Fencing</h4>
<p>In some places naturally or artificially established seedlings grow close enough to each other to make fencing groups of young oaks potentially less expensive than fencing individual trees. Securely fencing fifty trees on a half acre requires about eight thousand linear feet of barbed wire, one hundred fifty light steel T-posts, and four double-braced four-by-four wooden corner posts. Because installation of this type of fencing requires special equipment and skilled labor, the total cost per tree will likely be greater than that for fencing for individual trees installed by unskilled volunteer labor using simple tools and supervised by contractor personnel. Furthermore, fenced areas will continue to hold large quantities of annual plant biomass, increasing the chance that a fire which reaches such an enclosure will spread to all trees within it. Grazing between individually enclosed trees lessens this risk.</p>
<h4>Other Devices</h4>
<p>Ranchers have employed other schemes to protect trees in grazed areas. For example, four wooden pallets can be wired together to enclose individual seedlings. Though this technique can be implemented with minimum expenditure for materials, it will add substantially to the fuel load on the reserve, and will increase the risk of tree mortality resulting from ground heating in the event of fire. Another alternative entails cutting out the bottoms of fifty-five gallon drums and staking single drums around individual trees. This method appears inferior in effectiveness, and at least as costly as the wire cages described above.</p>
<h2><a name=""conclusion""></a>Conclusion</h2> A successful application of HRM in the foothills will entail substantial departure from past practices. The integrated nature of HRM demands that all stakeholders participate wholeheartedly. Such participation implies broad consensus about management objectives and how they may be attained, with resulting alignment of interests.</div>"

<p>What do you think about human population increase, natural resource depletion, environmental pollution, and social ills? How successfully may we address these issues with technological innovation aimed at altering the material world, or with cultural evolution driven by governmental policy or ""market forces""? Or are these ""problems"" and ""solutions,"" as well as many others, mutually reinforcing maladaptive behaviors? How may we shed light on such questions, and by what transformative process might we reach a vantage point from which to examine our circumstances and behaviors from fresh perspective?</p>
<p>The languages we hear and speak, read and write, are defining qualities of our being. On the following pages are a few ideas about the role of language in our lives, and about changes to language by which we at <em>Magic</em> are aiming to enhance our own and others' capacity to adapt successfully.</p>
<h2><a name=""verbal""></a>Importance of Human Verbal Language</h2>
<p>Though many organisms communicate with others of the same species, humans are unique in extensiveness and complexity of word language. With each passing day, linguistic enterprise-hundreds of separate languages, thousands of dialects, wireless and fiber-optic networks, computers and high-speed presses, print and broadcast media, libraries of books, microfilm, and CD's-is becoming more central to human existence.</p>
<p>Anyone reading these words likely experiences much less of nature directly than did most people in the past or do most humans today. We have stripped away darkness of night and cold of winter. What we see, hear, smell, taste, and touch is increasingly that already shaped by human endeavor. Though buildings, machines, clothing, etc. are important elements of our enterprise, language is remarkably pervasive and influential artifact. Increasingly, what we ""know"" is a word representation of our own and others' experience. We live awash in word.</p>
<h2><a name=""maps""></a>Maps and Territories</h2>
<p>You probably readily perceive a difference between fire and the word ""fire."" Something is missing in the latter, however vivid your recollection of all that you associate with it. You likely also distinguish between learning that fire burns by placing a hand in flame, and learning ""fire burns"" by hearing another's admonition.</p>
<p>Interacting directly with fire we experience natural law unbuffered, and uncolored by others. By continuing interaction we may test and refine our understanding.</p>
<p>Relying upon word, however, we distort and delete. Passing our words to others, or hearing theirs, we are often loosely coupled to the experiences being described, and we commonly lack ready means to check accuracy of what they or we have absorbed. Many of us take great pleasure in the thought of learning from others' mistakes. Yet by our reliance upon symbolic representation, we may actually more often learn their mistakes.</p>
<p>Though some tout ""virtual reality"" as a coming attraction, we live increasingly ""virtual"" existences from the moment we begin to acquire language. The world of word is but an approximation. Like mapmakers, we labor from imperfect knowledge with limited symbols. And like map users, we travel more safely when we remember that representation and referent are distinct.</p>
<h2><a name=""language""></a>Language as Mirror of Experience</h2>
<p>Humans write and speak to communicate diverse messages: joy and sorrow, technique and purpose, memories and aspirations. In language we see reflected the world-view of those who speak it today or who spoke it in the past. Just as anatomy and physiology reflect DNA-encoded information sufficient for ancestors to survive and reproduce, so does contemporary language evidence kinds of communication which have proven enduring. With each new word and construction, and with every iteration of pre-existing vocabulary and grammar, we create and recreate language.</p>
<h2><a name=""experience""></a>Experience as Mirror of Language</h2>
<p>To the extent that we think and communicate verbally, we conform mentation and interaction with others to language. Native tongue, second and subsequent languages, jargon, slang, dialect, and even personal preference for certain words or sentence structure are all factors in linguistic identity or idiolect. By lingusitic habit we reveal and redefine self, shape listeners and readers, and lay a foundation for interaction with nature and artifact.</p>
<p>Benjamin Whorf, a pioneering linguist who lived during the first half of the twentieth century, hypothesized that the language into which we are born serves as both a foundation for-and a constraint upon-how we view the world. Investigators have confirmed this assertion with oft-repeated cross-cultural studies.</p>
<p>By examining the place of words we read, write, hear, speak, and think in our lives, each of us may gain a better understanding of how person and idiolect become reciprocal images. By learning to be more aware as we apprehend, construct, and disseminate language, we may gain capacity to develop more as we intend.</p>
<h2><a name=""freedom""></a>Freedom</h2>
<p>Many of us both celebrate and seek personal freedom, defined as ""exemption from necessity or restraint."" By abandoning language of obligation and compulsion we may enhance freedom.<br/>Consider words like ""must,"" ""ought,"" ""should,"" and ""have to."" Do you speak and think in these terms? Do you interpret them literally? Or do you perceive them to be camouflage for choice and pretense to compulsion or coercion? Perhaps you ""automatically"" understand these words as mere expression of preference.</p>
<p>How often will failure to satisfy imperatives we utter or hear result in penalty beyond substitution of one pleasure for another? Why do we shrink from admitting self-determination?</p>
<p>Consider for example, ""I want to stay, but I must go shopping."" What is truly at stake? Why do people balk at terminating interaction freely? How will we feel if more of us admit autonomy, and say
""want to ..."" or ""am going to ..."" when that is what we mean?</p>
<p>What do we achieve by telling others what they ""should,""
""ought to,"" ""must,"" or ""have to"" do or be? Who are we to claim to be correct in such conclusive directives? How do we justify imposing what may be merely personal idiosyncrasies on others?</p>
<p>Where lie the sources of the imperatives and necessities we currently recognize? What may we gain by offering instead the evidence from which we conclude, and inviting choice? Rather than, ""You must tell the truth,"" let's confess, ""I have lied and have rarely felt good doing so."" If we decide on the basis of common information, will we more often act in harmony?</p>
<h2><a name=""guilt""></a>Guilt</h2>
<p>For speakers of English, the verb form ""should have"" may be little but language of guilt. Consider, for example, ""I should have been kinder to you."" With such words we express desire for something other than what we remember. To wish for a different past is futile. We may be more satisfied if we accept the consequences of what we have done and been, affirm principle, admit error, and formulate a plan for remedial action without
""should have."" For example, ""I value kindness. I was inconsiderate to you. I apologize. I intend to be more thoughtful in the future.""</p>
<p>Many of us have felt guilty. Upon reflection perhaps you can imagine living guiltlessly. Rather than suffer today as we bemoan past behavior, we can focus upon being grateful for what we have learned and upon how we may apply it.</p>
<h2><a name=""regret""></a>Regret</h2>
<p>You may agree that ""would have"" and ""could have,"" though lacking the element of compulsion present in
""should have,"" are other words by which we may express a desire to deny what is already done. Perhaps we may fairly label them a language of regret. For many, regretting is as unpleasant as guilting.</p>
<p>How will we change if we replace ""would have"" and ""could have"" with words of resolution: ""Next time, I plan to
...""? What burden will we lift from others by sparing them criticism in terms of what they ""would have"" or ""could have"" been or done?</p>
<h2><a name=""generosity""></a>Generosity</h2>
<p>Almost all of us recoil at the thought of being greedy. Yet few of us have mastered a language consistent with generosity, a language of expanded self, by which we unwaveringly express determination to find mutual satisfaction, rather than settle for gain achieved at others' expense.</p>
<p>To what extent do we offer, and to what degree do we demand? How often in a day do we say, ""I want?"" and how often do we ask, ""What may I give you?"" In what circumstances might we beneficially intervene with, ""How can we both come away from this interaction feeling good?"" And when might we simply give quietly and anonymously, rather than speak at all?</p>
<h2><a name=""violence""></a>Violence</h2>
<p>Many, especially the males among us, liberally employ language of violence. We ""whip"" each other in games like tennis, and ""beat"" our rivals to the market in business. As we move into an era when individual human futures are increasingly joined, the circumstances in which violence among people is adaptive may be shrinking.</p>
<p>Might we benefit by more often emphasizing the peaceful and gentle aspects of life? ""Both of us played well."" ""Many customers appreciated our new product."" Will we necessarily talk peacefully to live that way?</p>
<h2><a name=""legalism""></a>Legalism</h2>
<p>Both at home and abroad, critics of the United States label us an overly-legalistic society. Some assert that we live with proportionately more laws, lawyers, and lawsuits than any other people. Collectively we devote enormous quantities of life to arguments about the letter of each message, often apparently indifferent to the potential for improving all our lives by reallocating the same resources to learn attitudes more cooperative, and thus become more able to rely upon communicative styles less rigid.</p>
<p>We have made language complex to the point of obscurity. Even in everyday life we are turning with increasing frequency to specialists for the agreements by which we define interactions with others. What do we gain by treating each other so treacherously that we are without the ability to speak or write what we think and feel, and still feel comfortable and secure? How many ""party of the first part"" and ""plaintiff alleges"" do we need to live harmoniously?</p>
<p>In a perhaps related development, many are relying more upon language of qualification, sometimes equivocal to the point of emptiness, and seemingly designed to protect us against later being held to any firm standard. We are ""willing"" or ""committed,"" and we ""promote"" and ""encourage."" Rarely do we promise to achieve a measurable result. Perhaps if some of us are a bit less harsh in criticizing each other, a little more generous in shouldering responsibility for failure and sharing credit for success, more of us will be better able to express intention in definite terms, and to realize it.</p>
<h2><a name=""humility""></a>Humility</h2>
<p>""Politicians are crooks."" ""(Race, religion, nationality) are (adjective)."" ""Love is . . ."" If we use the verb ""to be"" to establish our own private experience as the reality, we invite dispute. With bold, sweeping generalizations about good and evil we reveal misplaced confidence in what we know. If we are quick to judge, to assert views, and to defend ideas far beyond personal experience, we may be revealing a desire for control of that which lies without us. To what extent are such ambitions consistent with attaining peace within and with others?</p>
<p>Can we learn to enjoy a consciousness filled more with questions than with answers? Will we create a more healthful and adaptive social milieu by shaping a larger portion of thought as gentle interrogatives? Each of us is but a small portion of humankind. Perhaps we will become more satisfied if we think of ourselves as possessing only a billionth or so of human truth.</p>
<h2><a name=""possessiveness""></a>Possessiveness</h2>
<p>For at least several centuries, the architects of Euro-American culture have sought satisfaction and happiness by increasing environmental manipulation. Some claim that ideas of ownership, which we have extended in slavery-and in surprisingly many other relationships-to human beings, has been central to this process.</p>
<p>How do we further our purposes by talking as if any person owns the Earth or some part of it, or as if some other person is ""ours,"" whether as spouse, employee, lover, or child?</p>
<p>Can we develop a consciousness of stewardship towards the Earth and respect for each other by using less often the possessive, both the verbs ""to have,"" ""to own,"" etc. and the pronouns ""my,"" ""our,"" ""your,"" etc.? How will relationships between parent and child be altered if we cease speaking of my/our son, daughter, father, mother?</p>
<h2><a name=""integration""></a>Integration</h2>
<p>Today, notions of fragmented self abound. Many refer to body, mind, spirit, soul, ego, id, conscience, as though separable. Speakers of some languages (e.g. Balinese) are reported to find such talk nonsensical. May we feel less conflict if we eschew partial selves?</p>
<p>What do you intend when you say ""I made myself do it,"" or ""She forced herself to go?"" Can we simplify our lives and enhance our freedom by saying ""I went,"" or ""She did it""? Will we feel more relaxed and at ease when we live as ""I""?</p>
<h2><a name=""subjectivity""></a>Subjectivity</h2>
<p>As we shed the languages of obligation, guilt, and divided self, we can more clearly see how powerful we are. Instead of being passive objects: ""I was stung by a bee,"" or ""You make me angry,"" we become important and, in many cases, preeminent:
""I stepped on a bee,"" or ""I'm angry."" Viewing the world this way, we are more likely to ascribe value to personal change. We are subjects, acting, feeling, being. Rather than focusing on externalities, we may turn more frequently to our own choices and acts.</p>
<p>In some contexts, people with power over others have decreed the eradication of self in written communication by mandating depersonalized action and passive voice. We may see such edicts reflected in much contemporary ""scientific"" literature: ""The material was processed ... and it was observed ..."" Many within and without the scientific establishment assert that such language is intended to bolster claims to ""objectivity,"" and thus enhance credibility of scientific findings. Yet virtually all competent practicing scientists agree that enterprise is rooted in a combination of subjectivity and reproducibility of results. Those who represent it otherwise undermine its essence, making it less attractive and less accessible to many who might support, join, and benefit from it.</p>
<h2><a name=""reification""></a>Reification</h2>
<p>One specific and common way in which many of us avoid the role of subject is by reification, giving lifelike qualities to abstractions. Some say, ""Her pragmatism paved the way to victory,"" leaving us to wonder where we can find some of this substance to lay before us as we move towards personal goals. Are we better able to see a path to emulating another's success if we say, ""She was pragmatic and triumphed""?</p>
<p>Learning to think as subjects, we become less prone to reifica-tion. We more readily assume responsibility for the consequences of what we do. Instead of complaining, ""The pollution is awful today,"" we admit, ""We are poisoning each other by fouling the air."" ""Unemployment is up,"" we translate to, ""Larger numbers of people are failing to agree upon terms for sharing work and rewards.""</p>
<p>Unless we imagine a better life to await us in world full of spirits and demons, gods and goddesses, why reify?</p>
<h2><a name=""time""></a>Time</h2>
<p>When before in history has time been so precisely and ubiquitously measured? Electronic watches with accuracy barely imaginable only a few decades ago may be found today in small villages around the globe.</p>
<p>Many of us speak of time as a commodity to be invested, saved, wasted, spent, etc. like money. In fact, ""Time is money!"" is an expression with which most of us are familiar. With such statements we evidence the ubiquitousness of laboring for wages. But do we abase self and others by pretending human life can be exchanged like wool or wheat? How differently will we perceive the world when we replace ""time"" with ""life""? How much more careful will we become to evidence the values we cherish?</p>
<h2><a name=""exchange""></a>Exchange</h2>
<p>In recent years we have made measured, balanced, and recorded exchange more and more pervasive in human interactions. Today popular magazines are brimming with articles about ""getting as much as we give"" (or more) in such nominally unconditional relationships as marriage and parenting. We routinely talk of ""exchanging gifts,"" without second thought about oxymoron.</p>
<p>How will we ever behave in a manner which evidences compassion for those whose needs exceed their resources, unless we de-emphasize the language of bookkeeping? Of what benefit is contemplating a world where gift is common, owing unknown? By what language might we support such a vision?</p>
<h2><a name=""negativity""></a>Negativity</h2>
<p>How much negativity shall we entertain? Much that we portray negatively can be rephrased positively. How do you feel when you hear negativity? How do you feel when you speak it? Can you notice any difference if you speak in terms of being ""ignorant,"" rather than ""not knowing,"" of being ""yet to do"" rather than ""not having done?"" What ways can you discover to reduce negativity?</p>
<h2><a name=""absolutes""></a>Absolutes</h2>
<p>""All … none … every … always … never
. . ."" are short, simple words, with far-reaching meaning. We live finite lives of finite experience. Only very rarely will most of us enjoy knowledge so complete that we may accurately represent it with absolutes. By the simple act of adding a qualifier like ""almost"" or ""nearly"" we can remember and remind others of limits to what we know.</p>
<h2><a name=""superlatives""></a>Superlatives</h2>
<p>""Best … worst … most … least … biggest
. . ."" How readily in an age of advertising hyperbole do we utter these. But as with other absolutes, superlatives are generally beyond our ken. To pretend otherwise may be delusion. More consistent with what we actually experience are comparatives like ""better … worse … more … less … bigger … ""</p>
<h2><a name=""channels""></a>Channels</h2>
<p>Psychologists have determined that each of us relies upon a different mixture of sensory input. Some are tactile, some visual, some auditory, etc. For example, three different individuals might respond to the same presentation by saying, ""I get what you mean,"" ""I see the point,"" and ""That's music to my ears."" By learning to discern others' preferred sensory modes, we may tailor what we say and write to them, and understand them better as well.</p>
<h2><a name=""cost""></a>Cost and Price</h2>
<p>Frequently we ask, ""What did that cost?"" and the person of whom we inquire responds with a dollar price. In a superficial sense, the communication between us has been successful, since often we ask to learn what we might expect to pay.</p>
<p>Implicit in the laws of nature are costs which are only partially reflected in the prices we generate from our own partial understandings of value. Examples include pollution, depletion of finite stocks of natural resources, and a host of other factors yet to be monetized adequately, or at all.</p>
<p>As humans operate more rapidly and on larger scales, we encounter more limits of natural systems. Thinking in terms of ecological costs, including ""externalities,"" we may see more clearly a way to conform economic ideas of value to ecological ones.</p>
<h2><a name=""development""></a>Development</h2>
<p>We frequently hear calls for ""development"" to better human life. Those who advocate ""development"" usually mean conversion of nature to artifact (e.g. - building, paving, and manufacturing). The history of such activities is one of disappointment for many and privilege for few. There are more buildings, roads, and manufactured goods on Earth today than ever before, yet more people starved or suffered debilitating disease last year than in any prior. What kind of development will further common interests?</p>
<h2><a name=""conclusion""></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>These are but a sampling of the changes that we at <em>Magic</em> are testing as we tailor language to serve our vision. If you search, you may soon discover a whole slough of other linguistic quirks and nuances more important to you than the examples offered here.</p>
<p>We will appreciate you for sharing this essay with any audience you think will enjoy it, and we look forward to hearing your comments, as well as any insights you think we may find illuminating.</p>

<h2><a name=""introduction""></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>To plan successfully we learn to predict accurately. Only to the extent that we can correctly anticipate the outcomes of contemplated action can we make real and meaningful choice.</p>
<p>Many agree that the scientific method is unparalleled as a means to discern and describe the repeated patterns by which we are able to foresee consequences. During the past century people have accelerated the integration of scientific disciplines and the extension of the scientific domain to encompass more and more of the human experience. Ecology, the scientific study of interaction between life and the environment, is a product of these trends.</p>
<p>Increasingly, planners are finding ecological analysis, with its broad applicability to human concerns, and its reliable results, a uniquely sound framework for decision at every level from individual life to global enterprise. Of the foundations of ecology, the laws of classical thermodynamics, Albert Einstein had this to say:</p>
<blockquote>""A theory is more impressive the greater is the simplicity of its premises, the more different are the kinds of things it relates and the more extended its range of applicability. Therefore the deep impression which classical thermo- dynamics made on me. It is the only physical theory of universal content which I am convinced, that within the frame- work of applicability of its basic concepts, will never be overthrown.""</blockquote>
<p>The political and economic analyses on which many of us have relied heavily in recent decades will likely persist as grounds on which we negotiate with each other for relative advantage. But we carry out our plans on a field larger than human society: we also interact with other life and with the Earth. While we may triumph over one another in the legislature, the courts, the administrative agency, or the marketplace, and while we may even appear temporarily to have conquered Nature, we will discover these to be illusory and hollow victories unless we play in accordance with ecological principle. Natural law is always enforced. As the human population grows and our impact on natural systems increases, we encounter with increasing frequency the limits imposed by Nature.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of this writing is to invite a step back from habitual thought and perception, that we may consider community planning afresh. People can structure a more democratic and more fruitful planning process by affording participants shared access to accurate information about the advantages and sacrifices inherent to available choices. We offer here an approach to acquiring such information, and invite our readers to test its validity against your own experience. We intend this document as a prelude to a plan, a solid foundation from which planners can proceed to ascertain and articulate goals and objectives which express the preferences of a given community within the realm of the possible.</p>
<p>We begin by outlining a rudimentary framework for ecological analysis. Next we apply this framework to explore what fundamental values humans share, and to assess how well we are furthering those values by our current ways of being. Then we turn to the question of settlement patterns, and examine both how we have arrived at our current situation, and how we may plan towards a more satisfying future. We close with an invitation to partnership.</p>
<h2><a name=""factors""></a>Factors</h2>
<p>In an ecological approach we select some organism or population as a focal point. Everything with which this individual or group interacts we then define as the environment.</p>
<p>For our purposes the human species is central. The natural and artificial entities with which humans interact comprise the environment. We may conduct a simple, yet illuminating ecological analysis of the human condition in terms of four factors. Two, population size and information, pertain to humans. Two others, resource and hazard, are qualities of the environment.</p>
<h4><a name=""numbers""></a>Numbers</h4>
<p>Our numbers are critical. We live on a finite planet. By increasing human population size we decrease per capita natural resource.</p>
<h4><a name=""information""></a>Information</h4>
<p>Here we define information to mean the instructions we carry for interacting with our surroundings.</p>
<p>Much of our information is genetically determined and remains permanently fixed. In utero experiences, like those resulting from our mother's diet or the presence of drugs in her blood, also may shape us for life. An example of how genetic information determines our responses to the environment is susceptibility to sunburn, which varies with skin pigmentation.</p>
<p>We also may accumulate a more flexible kind of information by observing ourselves and our surroundings, and remembering. We may add to and subtract from this information with each experience. For example, we may learn to speak one language as children, and another as young adults.</p>
<h4><a name=""resources""></a>Resources</h4>
<p>Each of us perceives certain environmental elements to be useful. Virtually everyone can appreciate natural resources like clean air and water, and large numbers of us understand the importance of topsoil, of forests and fisheries, and of readily accessible high-grade mineral ores and fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Many also take for granted the value of artifacts like houses, machinery, and other intentional results of human labor. In our era, people are increasingly reliant upon information resources like books, film, computers, and telecommunications systems.</p>
<h4><a name=""hazards""></a>Hazards</h4>
<p>Elements of the environment which we perceive as obstacles to our satisfaction we label hazards. We have enjoyed great success in learning to escape natural hazards, like the many predators and parasites which plagued our ancestors but pose little threat today.</p>
<p>At the same time, we face a growing list of hazards which are of our own making. These include various intended and unintended outputs of our own activities, from explosives to smog. We can also generate hazard by communicating misinformation, either genetically or behaviorally.</p>
<h4><a name=""learning""></a>Learning</h4>
<p>Many people can find good reason to view information as the paramount factor of the four we have discussed.</p>
<p>With information we determine our numbers. Biologists agree that we are genetically informed to reproduce to maximum potential. From experience we may learn to make many children, or to make few, and techniques for doing whichever we choose.</p>
<p>With information we may recognize resource and exploit it, and we may identify hazard and escape it.</p>
<p>Perhaps most critically, with information we alter and augment information.</p>
<p>Learning is the primary means we currently possess to modify our information. The methods by which we learn, and the choices we make with respect to what we learn may be among the most important aspects of our lives.</p>
<p>Unlike the tens of thousands of generations of our ancestors who were intimate with a natural world, we live in an environment which bears the human imprint in its every corner. We learn primarily from each other, either directly or through the symbolic content of the words and other artificial elements in which we are immersed.</p>
<p>If we define culture in general terms, as information transferred among individuals of the same species by teaching and learning, then we may view it as a double-edged sword. With it we may learn from others' mistakes, but we also may learn their mistakes.</p>
<p>Relying on a system of human understanding increasingly self-contained and insulated from natural phenomena, we have exacerbated the risk that we may become part of a mass delusion, unaware of the laws of nature, though still subject to them.</p>
<p>By repeatedly questioning, testing, altering, and communicating our understanding about what we want and how we may secure it, we may contribute to the evolution of a more reliable human culture.</p>
<p>Millions of us enjoy access to information more accurate than that by which we live. We have opportunity to examine our lives and to replace the beliefs we acquired uncritically, often by accident of birth, with ideas better-suited to successful adaptation.</p>
<p>To shed illusion we will question 'conventional wisdom.' We will affirm our own and others' ability to learn and to change. In doing so we will teach these behaviors to our neighbors and friends, for inevitably we teach what we are.</p>
<h2><a name=""relations""></a>Relations</h2>
<p>Millions of people over many generations have developed the laws of physical science. In the process we have confirmed that these laws apply without exception to the entire known universe, including all of the living world. Whether breathing, conducting business, or planning a community, each of us acts within limits defined by fundamental scientific principles.</p>
<p>To begin to learn an ecological perspective, we will become acquainted with the First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics. With even this rudimentary skeleton of scientific understanding, we will be able to shed new light on our world and ourselves.</p>
<h4><a name=""conversion""></a>Conversion</h4>
<p>The First Law, often called the Conservation Law, states that matterenergy can be neither created nor destroyed, only converted from one form to another. Implicit in the First Law is the inaccuracy of human claims to 'produce' food, shelter, clothing, or any other material entity. We convert these from other forms.</p>
<p>When we regard manufacturing as 'conversion' we may more readily take cognizance of the full range of inputs and outputs, and of the many antecedent and consequent conversions of the cycles and flows in which a manufacturing process is embedded. As we cultivate such awareness, we are likely also to realize that although we may label some outputs 'by-products' or 'waste,' these almost invariably wind up somewhere other than 'away.'</p>
<p>Thinking in terms of conversion, we can place an imaginary bubble around a location or process, and observe the quality and quantity of flows through that membrane. If we contrast the ecological description we generate from such an exercise with an economic description of the same process, we discover that the former is more complete. By including reference to previously ignored matterenergy flows on the income statements and balance sheets of households, businesses, and municipalities we may make these more useful and accurate representations.</p>
<h4><a name=""degradation""></a>Degradation</h4>
<p>The Second Law, sometimes called the Entropy Law, states that every conversion results in net degradation. Though matterenergy quality measured in thermodynamic terms is but one yardstick by which we may judge value, many people familiar with the Second Law regard it a sobering reminder of boundaries within which we necessarily live. Viewed in the light of the Second Law, the growth of what we call GNP, which is really a partial measure of Gross National Conversion, may be more destructive than beneficial.</p>
<h4><a name=""ecologic""></a>Ecologic</h4>
<p>Sustained life on Earth is possible because there are flows of energy into the biosphere which can offset the degradations resulting from the matterenergy conversions on which life depends. Our energy income includes geothermal heat generated by radioactive decay within our planet, gravitational energy from the moon, radiation from distant stars, and light energy from the sun.</p>
<p>For billions of years, immense planetary cycles of carbon, oxygen, phosphorus, nitrogen, water, and other components of life have been energized by the daily ration of sunlight intercepted by the Earth. Wind, ocean currents, and the cycle of evaporation and precipitation are all sun-driven processes which we have diverted to human use. By doing so we have negatively altered the conditions of life for many other species and for some people as well.</p>
<p>By capturing a small amount of the sunlight which reaches the Earth, and converting it to the energy of chemical bonds, photosynthetic organisms provide the input by which the preponderance of known life on this planet is maintained. The growth of pasture grasses, of the cow that grazes them, and of the child who drinks the cow's milk, are powered by sunlight. In effect, degradation of the sun is the price of life on Earth. We and our domesticated animals now claim nearly half of the products of terrestrial photosynthesis, leaving many other animals with too little to survive.</p>
<p>We also have tapped the energy of ancient sunlight, converted by plants and stored in their fossilized remains, to augment contemporary rates of conversion. In the process we have precipitously reintroduced to the biosphere matterenergy which was withdrawn and sequestered over millions of years. The unwanted impacts of fossil fuel burning include growing instability of climate.</p>
<p>The qualities of life and those of the environment are like lock and key. Changes to one require changes to the other if they are to function together. Inevitably our reckoning of the extent and type of change we bring by our conversions is incomplete. And however benign our intention, we pose adaptive challenge for ourselves and for other life each time we initiate environmental change. By opening a sufficient gap between the pattern of a life-form and that of the environment we kill the individual or extinguish the species.</p>
<p>With our environmental impacts we are driving an accelerating extinction of species certainly unlike any which has occurred for more than fifty million years, and possibly unprecedented in Earth history. Conserving diversity in the biological portfolio may well be essential to secure the stream of unearned income from nature on which we have relied to date for our own well-being.</p>
<p>To restablize the biosphere we will learn to live within its income and within the limits of its resilience. Almost certainly we will reduce our numbers and our matterenergy conversions, and just as surely we will rely more heavily upon technologies by which we integrate with natural cycles more and disrupt them less.</p>
<h2><a name=""values""></a>Values</h2>
<p>Ecology has been termed 'the subversive science' because people who apply it to questions of value almost always arrive at conclusions which are in one or another way incompatible with central tenets of long-standing political, economic, and religious traditions. Despite this unsettling quality, most who become familiar with an ecological approach find its advantages too great to surrender.</p>
<h4><a name=""material""></a>Material</h4>
<p>If we undertake an ecological search for 'good' around which to build a positive vision of community, we might regard life and ask, ""What if anything is universally valued?"" One answer for which we find ample evidence is: ""That which enables survival, reproduction, and evolution."" Taking even a few moments to observe the living world, we can confirm that most organisms devote virtually all of their lives to feeding and breeding. That all life is participating in a vast evolutionary process is supported by a fossil record now 3.5 billion years long.</p>
<p>The human species is part of this pattern. Most of us behave as if intending to secure our own and our children's lives. Though we are surrounded by exhortations to put our attention elsewhere we continue to see 'job and family' at the core of our existence.</p>
<h4><a name=""transcendent""></a>Transcendent</h4>
<p>Humans have another side. From early childhood we are aware of the inevitable death of individuals. Those with even a modest knowledge of evolutionary biology realize that only a tiny fraction of all species which ever inhabited the Earth survive to this day. Astronomers have witnessed the appearance and dissolution of stars very probably surrounded by planetary systems much like our own.</p>
<p>If we live tenaciously clinging to ideas of individual survival, offspring carrying our genes and culture into the future, and life on Earth evolving forever, we are likely doomed to a sense of failure. All these processes will almost certainly come to an end. If we are to enjoy them while they last, rather than struggle to give them a permanence they lack, we will learn to accept their transience. In virtually all human societies we see evidence of activities reflecting an awareness of the value of transcending preoccupation with material life.</p>
<h4><a name=""balance""></a>Balance</h4>
<p>With these observations of what living things, including nearly all people, actually do, we have marshalled evidence that humans share a common purpose: to balance our desires to survive, to reproduce, and to evolve with acceptance of the inevitability of our own death, our species' extinction, and the end of life on Earth.</p>
<h4><a name=""expression""></a>Expression</h4>
<p>Thoreau is reported to have once remarked to someone, ""What you are speaks so loudly that I cannot hear a word you say."" Most of us communicate with far more people by the being that we exhibit in our everyday actions than we do with our words. The resources and labor we command in the service of our own desires, the direct interactions with the environment by which we satisfy those desires ourselves, and the ways in which we respond to others' requests and commands, and act to satisfy them are among the primary modes by which we define self and community.</p>
<p>To explore our own values as we express them in our lives, we might begin by considering some broad and near-universal categories of behavior. What do we eat? Where do we live? How do we furnish it? What do we wear? How do we groom?</p>
<p>What transportation do we use? What recreation or entertainment do we pursue? What government services do we rely upon? What education, communication, and medical services? Who cooks or cleans where we live? Who cares for children?</p>
<p>What goods or services do we provide in our work? How are these related to the world we want for children born today?</p>
<p>With what purposes do we live as we do? In what relationship do we stand to those who provide for our needs? To those for whom we provide?</p>
<p>What do we imagine to be the consequences of dramatic change in our responses to any of the above questions? By what might we be motivated to alter them? To save our own life? A child? A close friend? A thousand peasants? An endangered species of mammal?</p>
<p>What might someone who views a videotape of our days and nights, or a printout of our thoughts and feelings, say we value? How may we better reflect our most deeply held values in every aspect of living? To what extent shall we engage in cooperative activity to enable mutual satisfaction of common purposes?</p>
<p>With our responses to questions like these we lay the foundation on which we plan and act to determine our own character and to influence the quality of any community of which we are a part.</p>
<h2><a name=""trends""></a>Trends</h2>
<p>The Earth ecosystem is increasingly a mirror of human consciousness, and ours is a consciousness of plunging ignorantly into unexplored territory. Each of us can point to many instances of unexpected damage attributable to people's failure to question thoroughly before acting.</p>
<p>Here in the San Francisco Bay Area we have contaminated the air, the soil, the water, and the wildlife. With phenomena like destruction of stratospheric ozone by our release of CFC's, we have demonstrated that our impacts are truly global.</p>
<p>We make our willingness to leave the future to chance more dangerous as we augment the size, speed, and novelty of our undertakings. Our forebears might err in fruit-gathering with little consequence. By our own mistakes in nuclear power plant design we can induce cataclysm.</p>
<h4><a name=""eco-factors""></a>Eco-factors</h4>
<p>Earlier in this writing we noted that we might conduct a simple ecological analysis in terms of four factors: human numbers and information, and environmental resources and hazards. Now we will assess recent trends in each.</p>
<p>We are increasing the number of people, already at an all-time high, at a still-accelerating pace. Demographers currently anticipate a population at least half again, and perhaps twice as large as today's by the middle of the next century.</p>
<p>Though researchers are steadily accumulating new techniques by which to manipulate the material world, much of humanity is experiencing rapid and rampant information erosion. Infants born genetically defective or damaged in utero are increasingly numerous. We are causing additional degeneracy by willful or inadvertent exposure to toxicity. Hundreds of millions of children who live on the edge of death are growing up illiterate because their families lack the current surplus requisite to literacy education. Billions are embracing dogma of every stripe, from nationalism to religious fanaticism, from astrology to political and economic ideology.</p>
<p>We are depleting resource and generating hazard at peak and still-rising levels. Declining fishery, farmland, forest, and groundwater resources are typical of our wasting of nature. Crumbling roads and bridges exemplify our analogous degradation of artifact. Unstable climate, pesticide-resistant insects, weapons of mass destruction, and manufactured toxic substances all bear witness to how we are making both the natural and artificial environments more dangerous.</p>
<h4><a name=""frustration""></a>Frustration</h4>
<p>All of these phenomena are in turn reflected in our declining ability to further our common values. Survival is beyond the reach of the tens of millions who each year starve, or die from preventable or curable disease for want of understanding or treatment. Life expectancies, on the rise for more than a century, have recently turned down among large populations as distinct and unrelated as African-Americans and Russians.</p>
<p>Compromised by the myriad stresses of coping with environmental deterioration and population increase, both men and women in the United States are less fertile today than a decade ago. Parents lacking capacity to carry a well-developed fetus to term or to rear a healthy child are reproducing disproportionately large numbers of offspring.</p>
<p>Damaged children are absorbing parental and societal resource without affording much assurance that we are satisfying either individual reproductive objectives or common evolutionary goals. As we ignore science for dogma, we further dim our evolutionary prospects, raising the spectre of human extinction in our own time.</p>
<p>We are equally unsatisfied in our desires to feel connected to each other and the Earth. At levels of social organization from family to nation we may observe increasing alienation and conflict. Divorce, runaway children, homelessness, crime, terrorism, rioting, and war are becoming commonplace. More and more people, unable to eke out a living from depleted rural landscapes, crowd into the unnatural realm of cities. Diminished in our capacity to know and appreciate nature, urbanites take refuge in alternative realities, like television and video games.</p>
<p>Many born and raised in the United States are finding the material and social conditions of life to be more difficult than we had expected. Frustrated, we are looking for some way to salvage our dreams. Thoughtful people are awakening to the likely impossibility of this task, and are adjusting ambitions accordingly.</p>
<h4><a name=""remedy""></a>Remedy?</h4>
<p>To continue as we are is to suffer. Many positive qualities of human population and environment are in downtrends. A host of negative qualities are in uptrends. The good news is that humans are driving these phenomena, and are apparently doing so to a great extent on the basis of information which we may be able to supplant with something more conducive to our own and our children's well-being. A kernel issue of our times is: ""How may we transform the selves we see mirrored in global ecological reality into beings whose reflected image we will find more pleasing?""</p>
<p>Will we replace the trends to bigger, faster, more novel manipulation, to rigid belief and uncharitable blame, by a movement to more cautious and restrained action based in skepticism, observation, reason, and cooperation? Each of us provides a partial answer by how we live.</p>
<h2><a name=""settlement""></a>Settlement</h2>
<p>Implicit in patterns of human settlement on the Earth is a range of possibilities for our numbers and information, and for rates and types of resource depletion and hazard generation. Because our ability to fulfill our common desires depends upon the status and trends of these factors, the geographical distribution of humans serves as both a foundation and a limit for our lives.</p>
<h4><a name=""density""></a>Density</h4>
<p>Generally speaking, people can meet basic needs with matterenergy conversion of least disruptive quality and quantity where we and our artifacts are sparse enough to be sustained by local flows of renewable resource. The requisites of such sustenance vary from place to place, but if we think just in terms of food and warmth in order to grasp the overall concept, we can say that even in favorable locations, Earth will only rarely support more than about five to ten people per acre.</p>
<p>At densities higher than these, we require exponentially increasing matterenergy conversion to import resource and export waste. Furthermore, as we extend such densities over larger contiguous areas, we require yet another exponential increase in per capita conversion, again as a result of transportation requirements.</p>
<p>As we take further steps into urbanization, we rely upon additional technologies and more complex forms of social organization. Though each increment brings opportunities, each is also accompanied by greater requirements for matterenergy conversion.</p>
<p>Today the residents of a typical urban household in a major city convert matterenergy at a rate ten or even a hundred times as great as that of a rural peasant family. Though much of this difference may be attributable to continuing application of inefficient, outdated technology, or may reflect real discrepancies in quality of life, some part is due simply to the unavoidable consequences of extensive concentration of population and artifact.</p>
<p>As we move towards the twenty-first century people are weighing the benefits of such concentrations against their costs. For each additional person, house, or business we might well ask, ""What location will afford maximum satisfaction per unit of conversion?""</p>
<h4><a name=""future""></a>Future</h4>
<p>Let's assume that well-established trends will persist, at least for a time. With a combination of population growth, environmental destruction, social dislocation, and information shortfall we are plunging towards a leveling of human conditions stemming more from inability to maintain standards of decency than from newly found capacity to extend them.</p>
<p>By relying upon large-scale, complex technologies and organizations, we have increased our vulnerability. By the global nature of the phenomena with which we are undermining the quality of our lives we have made escape impossible. Many of us are seeing more clearly the futility of attempting to maintain familiar privilege.</p>
<p>In the face of these changes, current patterns of matterenergy conversion are proving less tenable, as are the types of human settlement we have built with them. We are being compelled to amortize dysfunctional capital assets, of which urban artifacts are prime examples, much more quickly than we had anticipated.</p>
<h4><a name=""reintegration""></a>Reintegration</h4>
<p>What will we discover to be necessary to enable each generation to live as well as that which precedes it? Will we reduce the human population, reduce the quantity and alter the quality of our matterenergy conversions, and inform these actions with widespread respect for ecological principle?</p>
<p>As we feel the full consequences of dense and extensive concentration of people and artifact, a growing number of us are finding compelling reason to deconstruct megalopolises. Carefully premeditated, this can be a regenerative transformation. Still we hear calls to 'save the cities' by net additions of population or artifact to major metropolitan areas. Though often couched in terms of social justice, the actions advocated by those who utter such appeals are poor means to further this end. With ecological analysis we can see that we may secure greater satisfaction of our common interests by investing in places less densely and extensively settled.</p>
<p>By what incentives may we end the squandering of dwindling resource on re-creation of anachronistic form? How may we better husband that which is currently in place, abandoning its least useful elements, and converting others to adjust both denseness and extensiveness of settlement to levels which rely upon matterenergy conversions of kinds and at rates which can be sustained for decades or longer?</p>
<p>By redefining our relationships to each other and to the rest of the world with reference to ethical and economic values which we have thoroughly informed with ecological understanding, we may halt destructive growth, and accomplish an orderly transition to a society in which we value quality over surfeit. By more rapidly aligning the laws of political economy with natural law, and further accelerating the acquisition of ecological awareness by market participants, we may slow or even arrest the cascade of negative impacts, many irreversible, which has characterized our recent past.</p>
<p>Just as we are paying bounties to retire gas-guzzling, pollutant-spewing older cars, so are we beginning to provide economic incentives to supplant urban artifact with nature, and to reshape it to more benign form. Tree planters and caretakers in the burgeoning 'urban forestry' movement bear witness to this trend.</p>
<p>That we have to date responded to environmental imperatives less rapidly and dramatically with urban design than with auto design is an indication of the greater 'momentum' of the former. The useful life, sunk costs, and resource impacts of buildings and pavement are typically at least one, and often several, orders of magnitude greater than those of an automobile.</p>
<p>In our era of accelerating change we may view the greater costs and permanence of urban design elements as incentives to look far and carefully into the future when we contemplate reshaping our settlements. What we construct now may endure for decades. We will be prudent to take accurate measure of existing trends, and to build with an eye to flexibility in the face of growing volatility.</p>
<p>In places with less artifact and fewer people per unit of land we usually find greater opportunity for reintegration with nature, and for fulfillment of human needs using local resources. Though we may feel tempted to crowd artifact and population into major metropolises in order to reduce land prices per unit of floor space, people have consistently found the ecological costs of such action greater than both their economic price and their ecological benefits.</p>
<p>We know this in our bones. That is why so many of us vacation and retire in the countryside. But to enjoy the present or accumulated fruits of a city career in the countryside or anywhere else, we will respect natural law and maintain the integrity of Earth systems.</p>
<p>What if our assumptions are wrong, if we shrink the human population, or discover new resources or information to alter the ecological equation? In these circumstances, we may enjoy the prospect of a long and happy future in which to resume our current course, assuming that we prefer it. If, alternatively, our assumptions are correct, but we continue concentrating people and artifact at high densities over large areas, we can expect to work harder and harder for less and less.<br/></p>
<h2><a name=""planning""></a>Planning</h2>
<p>Many of us have planned for a household. Doing so is in many ways analogous to planning for any other community. We begin by locating the boundaries of the planning area. Then we inventory its contents, assess the flows through it, and examine the social relations among its inhabitants, and between them and other people.</p>
<p>For a household we customarily draw the boundary at the walls and doors of a unit in a multi-unit building, or at the property line for a detached home.</p>
<p>How many human occupants are there? What is their expected tenure? What services do they offer and command? Are there pets, wildlife, microbes, plants, machines, appliances, furniture, books, clothing? What else?</p>
<p>What are the flows through the household? When and how do people come and go? What about other living things? Air? Water? Cars? Bikes? Food? Sewage? Mail? Electricity? Gas? Radio and television? Sunlight? Phone? Fax? Sound? Refuse? Furnishings?</p>
<p>From the terms on which occupancy is shared, what may we conclude about occupants' individual values and desires, and the power with which each advances them? And what do the stocks and flows of the household, and the aspirations of the residents reveal of the underlying power relationships between household members and the society beyond?</p>
<p>Analyzing the household in terms of all of these factors, we establish a foundation for planning. On the basis of a similar analysis we may begin to plan for a neighborhood, a municipality, a bioregion, a nation, or even the planet.</p>
<p>Most of us have planned largely in terms of money values. The global economy is undergoing wrenching disruptions as people bring monetary representations of wealth into accord with ecological reality.</p>
<p>When we plan changes which may endure for generations, like buildings, pavement, or utilities systems, we are prudent to anticipate the further internalization of real costs which we are effecting as we express ecological understanding in the patterns of our lives, and in the structure and processes of the marketplace. In this way we may make the necessary and inevitable conformation of belief to fact a process by which we reinforce our actions and enhance our ability to meet our objectives.</p>
<p>With an ecological approach to planning we emphasize thorough analysis, and enlist all participants in a search for accurate understanding. Once we have made our analysis sufficiently robust, we may consider alternative visions for the future in the light of natural laws which define the limits of the realizable, and of common values which are the foundation for human community. As we move forward, we can repeatedly apply our analysis to evaluate proposed goals, objectives, policies and programs according to reliable, coherent, and consistent criteria.</p>
<p>By coming to a planning process full of questions, ready to set aside preconceptions, and with an unequivocal sense of accountability to all whose lives we influence by our participation, we may improve the likelihood that our actions will bring community benefit. Determined to wield whatever power we possess to secure mutual advantage, we may plan more effectively towards the well-being of self, humankind, and the ecosystem on which we depend.</p>

<h2><a name=""introduction""></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>Can you name anyone who feels that the days are a perfect length? Almost all of us seem to feel hurried, and to carry a sense that life itself is too short. Of course we judge ""too short"" by the standards of our own desires. Wanting more than we get, we actually go so far as to claim that fault lies with the universe! ""If only"" is a wishful refrain familiar to all of us. Too often, we use ""if only"" as a gateway to a fantasy world where we may continue to build dreams of desire without being accountable to the laws of material reality. To live in these ways is to invite frustration.</p>
<p>We at <em>Magic</em> teach life planning because we employ it with satisfaction. While we pay lip service to the idea that the days are a perfect length, we have yet to incorporate that realization into our every moment. As we move towards this awareness, we plan, record, and review in different ways, aiming by each to align one or another aspect of our lives with our current intentions. The techniques we offer are a sampling of our practices, intended as an invitation to exercise your imagination in devising your own ways.</p>
<h2><a name=""time""></a>Time and Life</h2>
<p>Central to many contemporary social interactions is a notion of quantified exchange. So ubiquitous is our attention to exchange that many of us carry it into even such intimate settings as marriage or parent-child relations. So careful are we becoming to measure that which we offer and ask of each other that a growing number of us carry appointment books in which to schedule our lives to the minute. Before continuing to treat our very selves as commodities to be bought, sold, and traded, we might pause to clarify our ideas of value, and the means by which we aim to realize them.</p>
<p>We apply concepts of time to quantify certain aspects of life, but life can hardly be reduced to mere time. That quality can be as important as quantity, is evident in statements like ""time stood still"" or ""time flew."" Many people embark upon one or another planning regimen with attention primarily to time. To do so is to risk achieving efficiency without finding satisfaction. In planning towards satisfaction we first identify that which we value. Only then do we select our activities and the schedule by which we will order them.</p>
<h2><a name=""plan""></a>How We Plan and Live</h2>
<p>On one end of the spectrum of planning personalities sit those whom we characterize as obsessive, compulsive, tense, and hurried, while at the other are those we call lazy, indifferent, scattered, and slow. Most of us feel greatest happiness somewhere in the middle: aware, purposeful, relaxed, and balanced.</p>
<p>Some ""over-organized"" people plan to such an extreme that they compromise all else. Perhaps you are acquainted with someone figuratively chained to the clock, a person who seeks to be invariably prompt, exact in scheduling, and fastidious with time records.</p>
<p>Other people might be termed ""overdoers"" because they stay so busy that they rarely stop to assess their doing. Like anything else, life planning can be abused. By being too rigid or too flexible in planning, acting, recording, or reviewing we may suffer.</p>
<p>Like each of us, our planning styles and plans themselves will be unique. The techniques presented here are proven by the experience of many others, yet anyone who learns them will be prudent to regard them skeptically, testing them again against the choices and circumstances of yet one more life. Each of these methods may be a tool for increasing personal freedom. Use what you find valuable, and keep an eye open for possible improvements.</p>
<h2><a name=""necessity""></a>Owning Up to the Necessity of Choice</h2>
<p>We can't do it all! With the mobility, the information, and the social change of our times has come a new relationship between the imaginable and the realizable. Some say that we are increasing the diversity and intensity of human experience. Whether this is true or false, we are almost certainly increasing the ratio of that which is presented as opportunity to that which is truly possible.</p>
<p>As the pace of change quickens, and the certainty of the future decreases, choosing between present and future satisfaction becomes steadily more difficult. All of us strike some balance.</p>
<p>We are interdependent. Despite the illusions of autonomy we create by using money to mediate our demands for the services of others, each of us relies upon many millions of other people each day of our lives. And many rely upon us. Ours is a world in which individual futures are increasingly joined.</p>
<p>All of us experience boundary conditions, circumstances beyond our control. To fail to acknowledge these and to plan within them is to squander life. These conditions change. We plan best when we are well-apprised of our current situation, and able to predict with some accuracy at least the outline of a future. The science of ecology may be a tool without parallel in both these endeavors.</p>
<h2><a name=""decide""></a>How We Decide</h2>
<p>Most of us are habitual in many things, having decided them far in the past. At times we decide to escape and daydream, living in fantasy. On occasion we wait for the requests/demands of others. Some of us are serendipitous. A fundamental principle of life planning is that we find greater happiness when we carefully consider how we want to live, even if we ultimately decide to live largely on impulse. By becoming more conscious of the nature of our choices we may increase the likelihood that we will bring intention and action into consonance, and thus transcend many common stresses and dissatisfactions.</p>
<h2><a name=""defined""></a>Planning Defined</h2>
<p>Planning takes practice. Planning is writing. Planning begins with possibilities, and proceeds through priorities and performance to evaluation. Our objective is to enjoy maximum satisfaction in each activity. To do this, we match import to duration and intensity. Because we are continuously changing, we plan at regular intervals. The details we may alter from hour to hour, the lifetime goals we may modify only every few years or decades.</p>
<p>The basic resource of the human animal is a life. In considering the future and idealizing how we want to be, we implicitly define life goals. By writing these, we may come to greater awareness. Written goals serve as a record far more accurate than memory. They are specific. They may be reviewed and shared with others.</p>
<h2><a name=""lakein""></a>The Lakein Method</h2>
<p>A general method for life planning, useful in a variety of circumstances, is set forth in How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life by Alan Lakein. That technique is as follows.</p>
<p>Brainstorm for two minutes, writing as much as you can in response to the question: What are my lifetime goals?"" Then take another two minutes to clean up your list.</p>
<p>Now brainstorm for two more minutes: ""What are my intermediate term (2-5 year) goals?"" Take two minutes to add and clarify.</p>
<p>Finally, pretend that you will be struck dead by lightening six months from now. Take two minutes and write goals for the next six months. Then take two minutes and improve them.</p>
<p>Now rework the answers to all the questions.</p>
<p>The six-month question is a stimulus to consider how happily we are living. If our answers to this question are very different from our current lives, what shall we do?</p>
<p>Most of us discover conflicts in our answers. To resolve them we choose. This is the only way. We live but one life. Choice is essential. To choose, take one minute with each goals list and select the three most important goals. Then, take one minute more to select the three most important of these nine. You now have a lifetime goals statement. The process by which you generated it may be repeated as often as you like.You may want to rework it substantially now, but as you hone more finely, you will probably discover that you feel little desire to change it abruptly, unless, of course, the boundary conditions of your life are suddenly altered.</p>
<p>The second step to planning is to list activities. Putting each life goal at the top of a page, take three minutes to write the activities by which the goal may be reached. Be creative, imaginative, outrageous, speedy, uncensored, bold, foolish...whatever you can be to fill each page. Beware the temptation to list only obvious, externally evident 'doing activities.' What about 'being' certain ways? To conscientiously cultivate particular aspects of 'being' may be at least as important as doing. Thought and feeling underpin our actions. Human consciousness may well be the critical factor in the biosphere today. Take at least three more minutes to reconsider what you have written and refine it to your satisfaction.</p>
<p>Now ask for each activity: ""Will I devote at least fifteen minutes (less if I can complete it with less) to this activity during the next week?"" Draw a line through any activity for which you answer, ""No."" Your reasons are your own. Just be honest. Combine the remaining activities onto a single list, and rank them in importance from first to last. Then schedule them into the coming week, and record your actual performance for later review.</p>
<h4>To recap:</h4>
<ol>
<li>consider possible goals;</li>
<li>identify current goals;</li>
<li>consider possible activities;</li>
<li>identify important activities;</li>
<li>schedule activities;</li>
<li>act;</li>
<li>record;</li>
<li>review and evaluate.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name=""focus""></a>Alterations of Focus</h2>
<p>After outlining a lifeplan in the method popularized by Lakein, and living with it for a period, we commonly discover that our records contain some information we find superfluous and lack other data which we need. Some of us may cultivate consciousness of a certain aspect of living, such as the frequency with which we think or act in a one or another way, even though this may be invisible on a typical ""daily schedule."" Part of the joy of planning lies in devising our own paths to greater awareness of how we live.</p>
<p>Each of us may practice science in everyday life, theorizing about the presence of pattern in ourselves and our surroundings, and observing and evaluating data to confirm or disprove our theories. If we are to successfully predict how we will behave, and what consequences will result from our actions, we will do so on the basis of repeating pattern.</p>
<h2><a name=""living""></a>Living as We Plan</h2>
<p>What will you do today? Essential activities like eating and sleeping, routine tasks like maintaining your personal belongings, previous commitments, and unexpected crises can fill a life. Ironically, planning is most essential when we feel least able to do it! Planning for a few minutes each morning and evening can be liberating. The half-hour a day we devote to such activities is easily offset by the increased effectiveness we gain by it.</p>
<p>One way to succeed in living towards life goals is to set aside times in which to do this without interruption. As we learn to plan better, we can increase the amount of life in which we feel fully committed and fully engaged in living towards our most deeply held values. Selective recordkeeping, limited in duration and in focus, can be a foundation for assessing our progress.</p>
<p>Be aware of your own and others' rhythms. Know when you are best able to do what you do alone, and when you are best able to interact. Search for overlap in rhythm with those around you. Plan for the unexpected, leaving unscheduled life in each day. Rigid adherence to an unvarying schedule can be unpleasant. Learn to balance diversity and regularity. Doing nothing is impossible. Recognize the importance of dreaming, of looking inward and questioning, of 'being' even when apparently 'doing' very little.</p>
<p>Transition times, like lunch, breaks between activities, waiting in line or for someone, and commuting can all be lived to advantage. By posing a question before sleeping, we may even learn to give consciuos direction to this third of life. Every odd minute here or there can be lived well and fully if we have a plan for doing so.</p>
<p>A daily ""to-do"" list is close to imperative. Write what is important. Conscious choice throughout the day is essential. What is important? Back-up lists of ""to-do someday"" items are a way to filter, noise from the daily list. Group activities by function, or work content, or location, or person, or whatever you find useful. Stay aware of priorities. Better three A items completed than ten C items. Many undone C's become Z's.</p>
<p>The 80/20 rule states that often, eighty percent of the cost or benefit of an activity accompanies the first or last twenty percent of the effort. ""How much value flows from what part of the activity?"" is the underlying question. By carefully assessing this, we learn when to cultivate perfection and completion and when to settle for approximation and partial performance.</p>
<p>Be careful in accepting commitments. Often we may postpone final decision, by agreeing in the moment only to consider something. Over-booking is easy. The results can be shoddy performance, bad feeling, or lost perspective.</p>
<p>With a goals statement, a schedule, and a ""to-do"" list we are equipped. Yet all of these are but tools for answering the question, ""How shall I live the next minute, hour, week, month, year, decade, lifetime, with greatest satisfaction?""</p>
<p>When we feel hesitation, we are wise to question. Intuitive reluctance to tackle a task is often well-grounded. Better to clear the way than to rush headlong into discomfort. Rigidity can carry a heavy price in a rapidly changing world.</p>
<p>If we feel overwhelmed or find a task unpleasant, we can sometimes make it manageable by breaking it into pieces or allocating small, fixed amounts of life to it. As a general rule, the more detailed the plan, the more certain is action. If we feel blocked, to imagine that we are planning for someone else, who shares both our goals and our boundary conditions, is a way to move beyond paralysis into action.</p>
<p>Getting more information is another way to warm up to a task. Information gathering is usually pretty painless, and in the process of learning, we become engaged. Select a leading task, one which is prerequisite to the rest. Begin the appropriate activity, typing, walking, dialing the phone, whatever...</p>
<p>Be sensitive to moods. Finding a way to accommodate feelings while still dealing with the important activities we have chosen is critical to living well. Is there any aspect of the high-priority task we can imagine tackling with pleasure, or at all? Make promises, and keep them. Set times for completion, and meet them.</p>
<p>When tired or bored, we may satisfy desires for change within the context of the task at hand. Beware tangents. An activity which is other than critical to completion of priority tasks, however cleverly rationalized, is a relative waste of life.</p>
<p>If we shrink from a priority task, we may benefit by slowing down and reconsidering our feelings. A rapid shift to something else can be a way to obscure important cues. Once we have begun a task, however unpleasant, we gain by doing it with joy. Only a fool adds voluntary bad feeling to an already difficult assignment. Remember that failure to act will likely result in failure to achieve that which we have labeled important. We can often generate enthusiasm for our choices by simply deciding to do so.</p>
<p>Fear is an underlying element of much procrastination. Techniques for dealing with fears include containing them, acknowledging them and deciding to proceed anyway, extinguishing them, rationalizing them away, responding to them with positive action, and exaggerating them to expose their relative unimportance.</p>
<p>Consider the price of delay. Usually, in addition to the obvious costs, there will be more subtle consciousness costs as we pay the price of worry. Why think about the thing without doing it? We can stress the benefits of action, and learn to act more decisively.</p>
<p>Common escapes include indulging in consumptive activities, socializing, reading, repetition of known ineffectual behaviors, running away, daydreaming. If we take one of these, and admit to wasting life, we reduce the likelihood that we will persist in it. We also can learn to cut off escape routes. One alternative is to simply sit, rather than do anything other than the priority task at hand.</p>
<p>We live on a ""daily best"" basis. Learning to salvage a day after experiencing failure is important. Planning, even in the face of overwhelming tasks, acting according to plan, avoiding escapes, maintaining a positive attitude, all of these require determination. If we start with easy steps we can build strength and confidence. Then wen we find the going tough, we'll be able to persist. We can learn to minimize losses as well as to maximize gains. We can make planning something which we use, rather than something to which we are a slave. Practice for yourself, you'll see!</p>

36,Reflections on Science,science,"<div class=""main"">
<h1>Reflections on Science</h1>
<p>Since <em>Magic</em> was founded, science and loving have been the twin pillars of our organizational philosophy. From hard experience we have learned that what we mean by each of these words is often different from what others have come to understand by them. We have written the following to explain how we define science, and why we deem it so important that more of us refine and extend our practice of science.</p>
<p>We use science in a very specific way, to refer to</p>
<ol>
<li>a set of behaviors, and</li>
<li>what we have learned by those behaviors.</li>
</ol>
<p>The set of behaviors we call the scientific method. We include in it: questioning, observing, reasoning, imagining, testing, and repeating this process. By observing, we mean with our eyes, with our other senses, and with our consciousness, as when we 'look inward.' We mean using our naked senses, as well as the instruments we have invented to extend our senses.</p>
<p>What humans have learned by the scientific method includes the contents of the various scientific disciplines, plus a great deal more. In fact, it includes much of the information by which you and we live our everyday lives. Consider the following example.</p>
<p>When someone trains a dog to sit, both person and dog can be practicing science. The trainer wonders how to turn a rambunctious puppy into a well-trained pet. She reads a book in which others describe rewarding the animal for obedience, and punishing it for disobedience. She uses biscuits and a shock collar to reinforce and discourage behavior in response to the command, ""Sit!"" If we imagine the dog's perspective, we view the situation differently. Wondering how to secure food and affection, Spot observes that the trainer can be a source of both, and learns to sit in order to get what she wants.</p>
<p>Of course people can practice science with varying degrees of competence. Someone can read and believe the first dog training book she encounters, or can follow the instructions in it blindly, without regard to the outcomes she observes, or she can consult a friend … In short, she can be full of questions, or ready to believe, very observant, or hardly so, extremely careful in drawing conclusions, or quick to assume, conscientious about testing the ideas she gathers to see whether they are a basis for her to predict with consistent accuracy, or full of rationalizations for beliefs at odds with experience, diligent in refining her thoughts, or convinced that she knows enough. By science we mean more than simply drawing conclusions on the basis of experience. To practice science well, we wring each experience for as much valid information as we may extract, and just that much. We fully exploit life's lessons, and we stop short of imagining them to be more than they are. Of course, any of us will fall short of such an idealized practice, but we may use it as a standard towards which to aim.</p>
<p>Seen in the light of the above discussion, everyday life is filled with science, and the lines between science and art, science and technology, science and loving are far from distinct. Consider your own life. How do you know which end of a telephone goes to your ear, to peel an orange but eat the skin of a tomato, how to read the characters on this page and make them into words and sentences with meaning, how to walk, how to talk, how to do any of the myriad tasks by which you care for yourself or others, or secure your livelihood? By the definition of science we offer here, you know all of these things at least in part as a result of practicing science. ""But,"" you protest, ""science isn't everything."" And we quite agree. By our definition, however, science is the only known way to learn from experience so that we may predict the future with better-than-random results. You and we may hold many other ideas which go beyond science, and we may be very attached to them, but we will fail if we use these as a basis for predicting.</p>
<p>Why do we care about knowing the future? Because we want to live in it, and we can only do so by meeting certain conditions. Our understanding of this is evidenced in the three questions which underpin each of our lives: ""What do I want? How can I get it? How do I know?""</p>
<p>Suppose for a moment that we decide to make science at least a partial response to the third question, and to use it, as we've described it here, to shed some light on the first two questions. What do we see when we consider our wants and the means to satisfy them? Looking at the world, we can see that survival and reproduction are distinguishing qualities by which we may differentiate living from non-living entities. Thinking about the activities at this very moment of the nearly six billion humans alive today, we can see just how important these basics are: about a third of us are asleep; another eighth are eating. A third of the rest of us are infants and young children. Already we have accounted for five-eighths of humankind. The vast majority of those whom we have yet to categorize are working to secure life's necessities for themselves and their offspring. This picture remains largely unchanged if we limit our field of view to a single continent or country, or if we travel through time to consider the lives of those who lived in the past.</p>
<p>There is another near-universal pattern of activity, less prominent but still ubiquitous. We find evidence of it in cave paintings and cathedrals, in pyramids and simple gravestones. Humans seek to become comfortable with the knowledge that survival is a game with an end, and that the lives of our progeny also will end. In every human society studied to date, we find signs of people's strategies for coming to grips with the transcendent, with what lies beyond material existence, beyond our senses, beyond death. The search for inner peace in the face of mortality, out of which much of religion and philosophy has grown, is another side of human yearning.</p>
<p>In just a few minutes, using a scientific approach, we have discovered that material desires like survival and reproduction, and transcendant desires related to our awareness of our mortality, are common to virtually all people. Almost without exception, each of us pursues some balance in satisfying these two basic categories of needs. An obvious question is, ""How might we use science to do that?""</p>
<p>We meet our material needs by interacting with our surroundings, including other people. How do we know how to interact? If we examine the cells in our bodies, we can see there certain instructions, coded in chemicals just as clearly as the thoughts on this page are expressed in letters and words and sentences. These instructions are the basis for many of the processes by which we remain alive. We also can examine our brains, and find there differently-coded instructions — some of them the results of our experiences — which inform other behaviors. These two kinds of instructions, the ones which are chemically encoded at conception or during our early development, and the ones we acquire through experience, comprise the entire known complement of information we carry. Like a piece of computer-controlled machinery, we are able to do only what we are informed to do. And like many machines, we have both read-only memory, (e.g. our genes) and programmable memory (e.g. much of the contents of our brains).</p>
<p>By scientific study of the history of life on Earth and of the current interactions of life with the environment we can discern a very clear pattern. Life exists by maintaining a match between the instructions it carries and the environment in which it operates.
(We use 'environment' here to mean all that with which an organism interacts. For any organism this may include other living things of the same or different species.)</p>
<p>Because each human generation spans a decade or more, we have relatively infrequent opportunities to revise our genes. A single-celled animal by contrast may reproduce every few minutes. So a great deal of our adaptation to environmental change comes as a result of learning. And we are in many ways well-equipped to learn. We have a variety of acute senses. We have a comparatively large brain. We have invented a host of tools, from books to computers, to radio communications by which to share our lessons. At any moment we likely face a diverse selection of possible futures, some more preferable than others in terms of the satisfaction we imagine. By our current choices we influence the likelihood of preferred outcomes. How may we choose the behaviors which make what we want more probable? By understanding the patterns of cause and effect. Any freedom we enjoy is an outgrowth of our ability to make meaningful choices. These depend upon better-than-random prediction. Such prediction in turn rests on the presence of repeating pattern. Thus, our successful adaptation, in terms of survival needs and reproductive activities, depends heavily upon our ability to learn well from experience. And this is precisely what we have defined science to be: a method for learning well from experience, and an accumulation of valid lessons thus learned.<br/>But there is more. We also recognized a set of transcendent desires. How may we use science to come to grips with these? First, we may explore their roots, in our awareness of the certain frustration of genetically-informed desires. We will die. The males among us will fall short of reproducing the thousands or even millions of offspring we are potentially able to sire. The females among us will also fall short of bearing the dozens of children of which we are capable. Individuals of both genders will face unwanted uncertainty about the well-being of those daughters and sons we do bring into the world. Even if we vest our interests in humankind, or more generally in life itself, those of us familiar with expeccted future of biological and planetary evolution face the disquieting thought that both people and all other Earthly life will someday almost certainly be gone.</p>
<p>We can place our faith in some unprovable but hoped-for afterworld, but the very inconcreteness of such an alternative makes it less than satisfying. Perhaps more importantly, believing in that which lies beyond experience can too easily be extended to denying experience itself when it is in conflict with our beliefs. With such behavior we undermine our ability to satisfy the material needs and desires pertaining to survival and reproduction which are informed by the genes in our every cell.</p>
<p>Ironically, a scientific approach affords some comfort. The cycling of matter and flows of energy through the living world are well-documented. With each breath, for example, each of us inhales some atoms which were once breathed by every single human who ever lived seventy years on this Earth! Ashes to ashes and dust to dust are literally true. We are but a resting place for sunlight on the way to heat, for mountains on their way to the sea. These are the facts, disagreeable though they may be in terms of our genetic agendas. Our task then, is to play out the genetically-defined role gracefully, tempering it with the lessons of experience so that we may balance living well and dying well. If we look, we discover that this conclusion has been reached by many wise people in diverse cultures widely separated in space and time. Moreover, we find that the ways of being all of them commend to us can be summarily described as
'loving.'</p>
<p>For centuries an ethos of materialism and denial has been ascendant among humans. We have increasingly neglected the need for transcendance by imagining that we might somehow avoid the certain frustration of genetically-informed desires which is inherent to our mortal nature. The alchemists searched for the elixer and the philosophers' stone with the hope of attaining everlasting life and unlimited power. Today the bioengineers and the proponents of countless other technologies continue this misadventure. Of course we want to reduce human suffering, but to pretend that we can succeed in that goal by curing cancer, or building a faster computer, even as we add a hundred million people to our population each year is something other than science. It is the pursuit of scientific know-how without admitting to the necessity of scientific know-why. It is, ""By what means?"" with too little attention to,
""To what purposes?""</p>
<p>Since the time of Galileo, perhaps long before, those who wield authority based in beliefs rooted beyond everyday experience have resisted the expansion of the scientific domain. Yet a handful of people in each generation have pushed the bounds of scientific inquiry and scientific knowledge further and further across the realm of human experience.</p>
<p>As we pass into the twenty-first century, we will redefine our relationships to each other and to the Earth we share. We will reconsider carefully the purposes to which we live, the ways we may further them, and how we know these things. If we become a species whose individual members are adept at the practice of science we will be joined in painting a more accurate picture of ourselves and our circumstances, and in using our understanding to live and die better. We will more readily resolve our conflicts by appeal to the lessons of experience, rather than to some authority. We will accept a less grand place for ourselves in the universe, and renew our attention to balancing material and transcendant desires. We will reformulate the social contract to reflect our fuller understanding of our current situation, including the increasing futility of seeking individual gain at others' expense. And in the process of accomplishing all these things, we may at last join science and loving.</p>

<p>Most of us act with the deliberate intention of making survival and love more certain for ourselves and for those close to us. How many of us feel encouraged by the ease and regularity with which we realize these objectives? Extrapolating the trends of the past few decades, who among us feels confident that the ideas and behaviors upon which we relied in the past will be an adequate foundation for living with satisfaction in the future? The purposes of this essay are to suggest that surviving and loving may now be more intimately related than we generally admit, and to outline an alternative to the approaches by which many of us have pursued them.</p>
<h2><a name=""survival""></a>Survival More Difficult?</h2>
<p>For thirty years, Americans have been adjusting our expectations downward. In place of the bold dreams and confident humanism of the thousand days of the Kennedy Presidency we now have the rising fears and confused alienation of the nineties. More and more of us live with disappointment. Today, the 1950's and early 1960's, when we were termed a ""people of plenty"" and an ""affluent society,"" seem only a mirage. How many times have you read the newspaper or watched the television news and wondered, ""Where's the 'good' news?"" As more and more of us become aware of the lies by which we live, we are replacing the idealism so long a cardinal element of the American character with cynicism. And that cynicism is like a cancer upon our consciousness, appropriating everything in its path to its own ends, draining away self-esteem, undermining both will and ability.</p>
<p>Increasingly, we look to the future with apprehension. Acts of official and free-lance terrorism reach into every corner of our lives. We live with vivid images of police beating a prone suspect senseless on network news, thousands fleeing in panic from the smoking wreckage of the largest skyscraper in the world in the aftermath of a bombing, one unhappy individual after another wandering through trains, restaurants, streets, schoolyards, and workplaces killing and maiming. Despite a quarter century of environmental protection legislation here in America, we continue to level our forests, extinguish species, deplete our fisheries, and foul our air, soil, and water. As extreme weather patterns resulting from our own activities bring unprecedented destruction to one locale after another, all but the most sanguine among us are beginning to wonder whether those who promised progress have seen the future clearly. Even though we claim for ourselves a grossly disproportionate share of the natural resource capital of the rest of the globe with ""trade"" conducted on terms negotiated under, and enforced by, threat of war, we lack the wherewithal to maintain our domestic infrastructure. Reports of crumbling highways and failing bridges are accompanied by sobering estimates of the labor and material necessary to replace them. In scarcely a generation, we have replaced the tasks of distributing abundance and adapting to leisure with the challenge of maintaining what we have, or more often, of trying just to hang onto the most important of it. For more and more of us, survival is an issue.</p>
<h2><a name=""degradation""></a>Degradation of Love </h2>
<p>Thirty years ago, many spoke enthusiastically, albeit loosely, of love. Love and lust, often associated in experience, were subsumed under the former with a wink. ""Free love"" and ""making love"" were euphemisms with which people made extra-marital sex and sexual intercourse itself topics suitable for polite conversation.</p>
<p>But when the ""flower children"" of the late-1960's embraced love in its dual meaning, they sought more than sexual freedom; they wanted also a gentler human society. They flocked to theaters to cry over romantic films like Love Story. The believed, or wanted to, when the Beatles, fresh from their encounters with an Indian swami, cheerfully promised, ""All You Need is Love.""<br/>When the people who generated mass media advertising campaigns turned in that era to explicit and subliminal sexual themes to induce us to buy, they added at least a thin veil of sentimentality and kindness. Models looked at each other, and smiled.</p>
<p>In the current era, lust is undisguised, and we find shrinking use for love. People talk openly, indeed proudly, about topics once taboo. We have supplanted admonitions about reserving sex for those with whom we intend to make a life with threats of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. College students list money at the top of their career goals and public service far down the list. High schoolers are more likely to carry guns and knives than love beads and pictures of love-preaching gurus. In movies, the lust-to-love ratio is enormous and growing. Few question a plot in which one character cuts off another's limbs 'for love.' The leading music genre is a hate-filled series of threats and put-down's from which melody and harmony have been banished. And advertising is stripped of any pretense to vulnerability. Models glower and sneer off the page at us.</p>
<h2><a name=""reclaiming""></a>Reclaiming Love </h2>
<p>How shall we put love, in the sense of caring for each other and the environment we share, back into our culture? Ours are lives of individualism and competition, where a very large proportion of what we do is devoted to exchanges of various kinds. How often have we been taught that by hoarding our talent and resources, and offering them only when we can trade to our advantage, we will create maximum satisfaction for all? Given this conditioning, who can profess surprise that we think primarily as individuals, emphasizing our separateness and uniqueness? To compete more effectively, we ask recognition and credit for even our very beings, downplaying the many accidents, both genetic and cultural, which account for so much of who we are. As we maneuver to enhance our relative status, we drain others of their value and arrogate whatever we can to ourselves.<br/>Focusing on the advantage to be gained by increasing our personal power, do we even imagine the greater security potentially available by satisfying the needs of all? More likely we treat interaction with others, including ""love"" relationships, as exchanges, and repeatedly question whether we are ""getting enough"" from them. How often do we hear ""She's too good for him,"", ""He ripped me off,"" and similar expressions indicative of this outlook? By demanding service or personal compromise of those we claim to love, we reveal pervasiveness of commercialism and exchange in our consciousness.</p>
<h2><a name=""inexperience""></a>Inexperience with Charity </h2>
<p>Even when we think we are magnanimously giving, we often speak of ""exchanging presents"" and almost always expect something, if ""only"" gratitude, in return. Among people who characterize interactions in these terms, the capacity to give freely is rarely well-developed. But do we acknowledge this openly, or do we conceal the extent to which we withhold and feel separate from others by promising to do, ""what I can"" for them, rather than admitting that we intend something far more limited than devotion of every breathing moment and every capacity we possess to serving them? Who will deny that ""what I can"" is less ""all I can"" than ""what I please?""<br/>How rare indeed is the ""I love you,"" which means, ""We are one; I serve our mutual being; your satisfaction and my own are equally important to me; even to the point of survival itself am I prepared to share equally with you the risks and rewards of living""? Love of this nature, when we do offer it, usually passes only among intimates: parent and child, husband and wife, and lifetime collaborators. Given the increasing impermanence and shrinking reliability of even these ties in our culture, such love may be on the verge of extinction. With how many others will you ""draw straws"" for the right to survive? Do you sense any connection between the rarity of this kind of loving and declines in our individual satisfaction and collective security?</p>
<h2><a name=""pursuit""></a>In Pursuit of Dominance</h2>
<p>For more than two hundred years, beginning at least as early as the era in Western European history presumptuously proclaimed ""the Enlightenment"", we have placed growing faith in our ability to increase our security by mastering new techniques for more rapid and larger-scale matterenergy conversions, and competing with one another in using them. How happy has been our choice to seek control over the earth, instead of learning to live gently upon it? How wise have we been to develop laws of property which perpetuate privilege, and to devote enormous resources to maintain the public and private armies and arsenals by which we enforce them at home and abroad? What have we gained by postponing action by which to redress the gross disparities in human circumstances?</p>
<p>Perhaps such behavior is understandable in terms of our historical relationship to our environment. Wherever we turned there were new frontiers with untouched resources. The pace of our scientific learning produced a seemingly endless sequence of new ways to make useful that which previously had been unappreciated. For awhile we imagined that all might share, if disproportionately, in this bounty.</p>
<p>In the absence of such relatively modern global threats as nuclear holocaust, gross atmospheric and oceanic poisoning, or the emergence of some super-pathogen through human malice or carelessness, survival was a much more individual task. Plague might sweep a continent, but some people lived in places sufficiently remote to escape danger. Parisians might party while Romans were besieged. Long after the English found wood too precious to burn, Americans wasted forests just to clear land. Separate communities were somewhat autonomous and self-reliant, and most of the world's people lived in ignorance of each other.</p>
<h2><a name=""future""></a>One Human Future </h2>
<p>Our situation is now quite different. We who are supported by the highest levels of matterenergy conversion are dependent on a global supply network. Accessibility of information by telecommunications has exposed our dependence. Those who slave so that we may luxuriate are increasingly skeptical of the justifications we offer for this inequality, and grow almost daily more ready and better prepared to disrupt our exploitation. Who can in good conscience ask them to accept promises that they may someday share in ever larger benefits from newly-discovered resources and newly-developed technologies as even we who managed such triumphs in the past recognize the completeness of our science and the finiteness of the planet?</p>
<p>Today our question is less, ""How shall we sustain growth and achieve a better life for all?"" than, ""How many shall die so that we may continue living as we do?"" Unless we reach agreement as one humanity on the bases on which this question is to be answered, our selection of potential responses is likely to become frighteningly narrow. Already we are constrained by a growing human population and an environment made lean by past plunder. After two centuries of industrial bounty and clever competition, we face a future less certain than ever before. How long shall we persist in our current approach? By what wisdom can we develop another?</p>
<h2><a name=""realities""></a>Old Ideals for New Realities </h2>
<p>For centuries, there have been those who devote attention to philosophical, religious, or mystical contemplation aimed at extending human experience beyond the sensate, material realm of everyday life. Some such people, termed moral philosophers, undertake a search for the ""good"". In their explorations, they inevitably consider the positive and negative qualities of various attitudes and behaviors towards other people, and frequently they speculate on the nature of loving. Within both the secular and religious philosophical traditions of East and West, are exultations of a loving ""oneness"" tantamount to complete identity of self and others. Both Christ and Buddha taught such loving as a path to personal realization, happiness, and enlightenment.</p>
<p>The seeming incompatibility of such a sense of self with the day-to-day behaviors by which some of us cling to luxuries while allowing others to perish has long been a source of conflict for thinking people. How often do the actions which promote our own welfare and those which protect and nourish others seem to lie on divergent paths? The compartmentalization of charity is evidence of our failure to reconcile these two goals. Despite the proliferation of service organizations, most of us continue to devote the majority of our life and other resources to insuring our own survival, admitting and even touting our gains at the expense of others.</p>
<p>Knowing that we kill or let die for selfish reasons, how can we anticipate any but similar behavior from others? So long as any are more powerful than we, where all of us live more from expedience than from principle, can we be secure? Suppressing awareness of the contradictions and paradoxes in our lives, we stubbornly repeat old behaviors. How many of us consider ameliorating the suffering of others the best way to lessen our own anxiety?</p>
<h2><a name=""evolution""></a>Evolution of Culture</h2>
<p>Humanity is now a far cry from the days when injury and death in the jaws of cave bears and sabre-toothed tigers, or as a result of other non-human-mediated events, inspired our greatest fears. Today the indifference and hostility among us may be the greatest risks we face. In a world where we are more cognizant of each other, and where even the relatively weak are increasingly able to affect any one of us, who will refuse to question whether the means by which we subdued and in some cases extinguished other life forms remain appropriate for use among us? Just as the tiger and the bear have gone, so may the missiles and bombs give way to new techniques for meeting the dangers of a different age. Rather than look outward for more sophisticated technologies by which to dominate our planet and each other, perhaps we will look inward to create an ethos by which we can quiet our fears.</p>
<h2><a name=""failure""></a>Failure of Narrow Self-Interest</h2>
<p>The actions by which we express fear are often the same as those by which we elicit it from others. They range from design and manufacture of weapons of mass destruction to isolated murders, from buying food away from the lands of the starving to burning gasoline for pleasure trips while the peasants of the Himalayan foothills deforest a subcontinent in search of cooking fuel. So long as we persist in our collective failure to make the security of all the goal of all, can any of us escape fear or find enlightenment?</p>
<p>By devoting resources to maintaining unequal access to satisfaction and survival, we reduce the amount of need-fulfilling goods and services which we collectively share. By our refusal to live as equals, we unnecessarily deplete all that can satisfy our needs. With our stubborn persistence in old ways we waste human life, land, minerals, and energy. Those of us who insist that we are entitled to something more than 1/nth of the world's resources
(where 'n' is the world population) are left to enforce our claim with threat and violence.</p>
<h2><a name=""love""></a>Survival and Love</h2>
<p>Some ask, ""Can humans be different?"" North Americans have long recognized the common interest in providing through government for the basic needs of the indigent. Private groups like corporations, unions, mutual insurance companies, and cooperatives may offer even more comprehensive benefits to members limited in capacity by illness, injury, or old age. Some families, communal groups, and monastic orders extend such protection to its practical limit, sharing resources on the basis of need and contributing to group welfare on the basis of ability. In this they are much like a number of non-Western, non-industrialized cultures which have existed in the past and endure in remote areas even today.</p>
<p>By learning to love in an ever larger, more charitable sense, by expanding our sense of self to include more and more of the world's people, we can take further steps towards mutual security. By joining with those whose needs are unfilled, we can lay the foundation for a society of peers. Perhaps in doing these things we will become less preoccupied with fear of one another, better able to find common purposes, more adept at living within the limits to earth ecosystem stability, and thus more likely to protect the ability of all to survive and to love, now and in years to come.</p>

<p>""Addiction"" has become common in English language usage only during the last century. Essential qualities of addiction, as the word was originally defined, were the regular ingestion of opium, the development of tolerance (i.e. - reduction of effects with identical dosage), torturous withdrawal symptoms in its absence, and anti-social behavior both to gain access and while intoxicated. Today we use the term in a much broader sense, to denote any of countless types of repeated behaviors where actual outcomes consistently result in failure to be satisfied.</p>
<h2><a name=""history""></a>A Brief History </h2>
<p>English-speaking people first became aware of addiction in the early 19th century, as a result of their participation in the manufacture and distribution of opium in the Far East. Towards the end of the century, European artists and literati began experimenting with a variety of psychoactive substances in search of new heights of aesthetic experience. Opiates, cocaine, cannabis derivatives, and assorted other substances which affected brain function became readily available, both in patent medicines and in admittedly recreational preparations, and an era of naive and widespread drug abuse was inaugurated.</p>
<p>Between 1900 and 1940, medical researchers discovered and synthesized an array of potent compounds which acted on the human brain. For awhile doctors prescribed them with abandon, but disillusionment came quickly. Addictive behavior which had previously been observed exclusively among opiate users, was soon evident among large numbers of those who had been exposed to whole new classes of substances, including barbiturates, amphetamines, and tranquilizers.</p>
<h2><a name=""scene""></a>The Current Scene</h2>
<p>As millions more people have become obsessive users of a growing pharmacopaeia, an ever more stringent set of national and international controls has been set in place to suppress what is now recognized as a global health problem of epidemic proportions. Despite continuing research into addiction, substantial law enforcement activity aimed at halting drug trafficking, and diverse e<br/>xperiments with treatment for the purpose of making something other than premature death the most likely fate of the addict, drug abuse appears still to be growing. Every year humans consume billions of doses of synthetic stimulants, depressants, and tranquilizers, as well as even larger quantities of illegal but naturally occurring psychoactive substances. Socially accepted drugs, like coffee, tea, chocolate, alcohol, sugar, tobacco, et cetera are now admitted to carry potential for addiction. In fact, more and more habitual behaviors, whether observable or confined to individual consciousness, are being termed ""addiction.""</p>
<h2><a name=""habit""></a>Habit and Adaptation</h2>
<p>Human adaptation and survival may be viewed as information processing challenges. There are far more stimuli impinging upon us than we can simultaneously process. One way that we deal with this is by putting some aspects of living on ""automatic."" Having once decided how to act in certain circumstances, we behave that way repeatedly without further consideration. A peril of this approach is that an act which is innocent in the first instance may become damaging if repeated. We also risk the possibility that the negative repercussions of an act occur after a substantial lag. Finally, changes to the environment may go unnoticed if we think we ""know"" what we are perceiving and how to respond.</p>
<p>While the ecologist will claim that all humans, indeed all organisms, are apparently joined in the fundamental purposes of survival and reproduction, individuals commonly aim towards additional, sometimes mutually incompatible goals. Questions of adaptivity are problematic, for we are without the ability to precisely determine the adaptive value of either our own or others' behaviors, including goal-setting. Looking from within the constraints of our own personal world-views, or the ethos of our own culture, we see a very partial and assuredly distorted reality.</p>
<h2><a name=""addiction""></a>Addiction as Habitual Maladaptive Behavior </h2>
<p>Addiction may be viewed as a special class of repeated behaviors, where short-term satisfaction is linked to longer-term frustration. Using the principles of ecology, we may generate a variety of plausible explanations both for the rise of addictive (i.e. habitual, maladaptive) behaviors, and for our growing consciousness of, and concern for them.</p>
<p>The ease with which an organism adapts may be viewed in<br/>terms of the ecological function. As population increases and resources are depleted, additional or altered information becomes necessary to successful adaptation. Over the past two hundred years, humans have increased our numbers in ways that are both absolutely and relatively without precedent. We have employed a sequence of steadily more disruptive technologies to convert earth resources to human use, with the unintended and unwanted simul-taneous effect of rendering the environment less fit to support us.</p>
<p>With our large scale organization of human activity and grandiose alterations of the environment, and with the speed of our operations, we have necessitated major changes in human behavioral adaptation. Under these circumstances, previously acceptable habit can easily prove maladaptive, and innovation, however inspired, is difficult to evaluate. More and more of us are finding familiar patterns untenable, yet few of us are confident that we have identified viable alternatives.</p>
<p>The current official focus upon addictive substances and the vast resources being marshalled to reduce their availability are indications of a change in attitude which we may trace back more than one hundred fifty years to the initial efforts of the Chinese to control opium. As all humans have become more tightly bound in our network of resource conversion activities, each of us is increasingly concerned with, and of concern to, being characterized as an integral part of a whole system, including both our individual selves, other people, and the remainder of the environment in which we live. From this perspective, those who address singular addictive behaviors in isolated individuals, seeking linear chains of causation, appear doomed to failure. An ecosystem is too filled with multiple feedback loops, where cause and effect are to some extent qualities of all system elements, to be accurately modeled with simplistic ideas born of a mechanistic paradigm. Viewed ecologically, with concern for relationships between individuals and the environment, addiction is more easily recognized as something impossible to vanquish without collateral change.</p>
<h2><a name=""shedding""></a>Shedding Our Own Addictions </h2>
<p>Why bother with addiction, and label it negative, rather than merely accept it as part of living? Many of us share a sense that addiction is somehow inconsistent with our deeper purposes. We find unpleasant the perception of freedom which we associate with addictive behavior. We recognize in ourselves and our environment a system out of balance, one that we have destabilized. And we want greater satisfaction for ourselves and others</p>
<p>What are our purposes? How shall we be satisfied? These age-old, fundamental questions are the framework against which we lay the stories of our lives to date as we look for evidence of addiction. What we find may vary from regularity in brushing and flossing teeth, which many will agree to be quite adaptive, to daily ingestion of drugs, which most will agree merits question, to repeated expression of anger by violence towards others, which almost all will deem an addiction of the worst kind.</p>
<p>Addiction may be characterized as an integral part of a whole system, including both our individual selves, other people, and the remainder of the environment in which we live. From this perspective, those who address singular addictive behaviors in isolated individuals, seeking linear chains of causation, appear doomed to failure. An ecosystem is too filled with multiple feedback loops, where cause and effect are to some extent qualities of all system elements, to be accurately modeled with simplistic ideas born of a mechanistic paradigm. Viewed ecologically, with concern for relationships between individuals and the environment, addiction is more easily recognized as something impossible to vanquish without collateral change.</p>
<p>How shall we extinguish addiction? Embedded in this question lies perhaps one of our most subtle addictions: we move so quickly to ""how,"" and shrink so rapidly from ""why"". Many of us have been taught, ""Not ours to reason why, just ours to do, or be fired, or ostracized, or violently suppressed.""</p>
<p>Living such a large fraction of our waking lives with this consciousness, with so much dependent upon steadfast adherence to it, we may well be losing both the appetite and the capacity for ""why"" thinking. Seeing so much that seems so contrary to common sense, which we are nonetheless expected to rationalize and carry forward with some enthusiasm, we become inured to the nonsensical nature of much that we do, and take it for granted. To question or challenge ""why?"" in the face of such widespread conformity seems futile, so we channel our energies to the ""how"" of living. In an era of profound and rapid environmental change, such behavior may be an impediment to the radical personal changes necessary to successful adaptation.</p>
<p>Ours has been an engineering age, an age of manipulating both the non-human environment and other people. The values of stillness, reflection, observation, are rarely taught, practiced, or rewarded. As so often seems the case with addiction, the very manipulative behaviors by which we imagine escaping our plight serve only to worsen it. At least at the meta-level, our determination to ""do something"" about our addiction, may be incompatible with observing it, and thus addressing the question of ""why"" in less mechanistic terms.</p>
<p>Addictive behavior might as well be viewed as the absence of some alternative way of being. Locked as we are into old ways, we fail to even conceptualize the alternative. Addiction thus might be explained more in terms of what we have yet to imagine and become, rather than in terms of what we are. Internal consciousness, rather than externally visible behavior, may be the neglected substrate with which we nourish addiction. Learning to observe our mental processes, and to assess them in the light of our objectives, may be a first step in abandoning addiction.</p>
<p>Most traditional approaches to addiction have proven only marginally effective. Wholistic techniques, usually including a period of residential treatment in a carefully controlled environment with intensive practice of alternative behaviors, followed by a careful transition to a less circumscribed situation where ongoing monitoring remains an important element, seem more promising.</p>
<p>We can restructure our own lives in analogous ways, using a pattern of observation, evaluation, and planning repeated over and over, to approximate ever more closely the vision of healthful self that we carry.</p>
<p>As ecologists, we deal with organism and environment in their entirety. We address individual, society, and non-human environment. All of us are to varying degrees free to move, or to alter the environment in which we remain. Though permanently related to family, we may choose friends on the basis of shared values. While stuck with our genes, we can alter much that we have become through experience. These are our choices.</p>
<p>For some time many of us in the United States have carried, in fact celebrated, an ideology of progress, rooted in the notions that we know what we're doing, that we're happier than ever, and that more of the same determined alteration of the environment will pave the way to heaven on earth. This belief, in fact all belief, may be our most debilitating addiction. If this be the case, then an ecological approach to living, robustly skeptical, rational, and empirical, may be a path to recovery.</p>
